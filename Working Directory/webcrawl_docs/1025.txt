Concordia University and Hydro-Québec have joined forces to establish a  new Senior Industrial Research Chair in the broad area of sustainable  energy systems. Building on the chairholder’s recent efforts in the  fields of energy efficiency, renewable energy and machine design,  innovative solutions will be developed to increase the electric  efficiency of the energy system and contribute to the conservation of  non-renewable energy sources. The Chair will further explore sustainable  and affordable energy sources suitable for Hydro-Québec customers, such  as: biomass, osmosis and small wind. The practical integration of these  sources will then be examined at particular customer locations in  settings ranging from urban office buildings to rural farms.
NSERC/Hydro Québec Industrial Research Chair
Dr. A. Athienitis: Optimized Operation and Energy Efficiency: Towards High Performance Buildings
Buildings consume over half of Canada's electricity production, making  the optimized operation and improvement of energy efficiency in  buildings an important step towards reducing our use of carbon-based  energy sources. Hydro-Québec and Concordia University have joined forces  to establish a comprehensive research program in Optimized Building  Operation and Energy Efficiency. With two additional key partners –  Régulvar in integration of automation systems and CanmetENERGY in energy  efficiency – the program is expected to result in significant benefits  to Canada. Building on the Chairholder's recent efforts in the fields of  energy efficiency, smart building operating strategies and solar  buildings, new knowledge and innovative solutions will be developed to  substantially enhance building performance.
NSERC/Ericsson Industrial Research Chair
Dr. F. Khendek: Model-Based Software Management
Uninterrupted service, even in the most complex software and computing  systems, has become fundamental in user expectations. Consider, for  instance, the Internet and its related servers—such as Google. End-users  require such systems to work correctly, efficiently and without any  service interruption. The NSERC/Ericsson Industrial Research Chair on  Model-Based Software Management provides strategic intelligence to the  Canadian computing and telecommunications industries. The Chair's goal  is to investigate modelling languages for platforms, requirements,  software and system characteristics. It aims to devise novel techniques  for requirement decomposition and COTS components  selection/configuration, thereby considerably improving the quality and  functionality of component-based systems.The Chair will explore new  methods to validate, deploy, monitor, reconfigure and upgrade systems  while maintaining critical characteristics—such as high availability.  The Chair collaborates closely with Ericsson—a major player in research  and development in Canada. This university-industry partnership provides  students with tangible experience at both Concordia University and  Ericsson, which which gives the students a competitive edge as they  enter the workforce and equips them with skills to strengthen Canada's  leadership in the management of software systems.
NSERC Industrial Research Chair
Dr. S. Hoa: Automated Composites Manufacturing
The NSERC Industrial Research Chair in Automated Composites  Manufacturing has for its objectives the development of composites made  using automated fibre placement (AFP) process. The supporting companies  include Bombardier Aerospace, Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Ltd.,  Composites Atlantic Limited, Delastek Ltd., and Emergia Aerospace. Other  collaborators include the National Research Council Canada, Automated  Dynamics, and CYTEC Engineered Materials. The Chair program will cover  three types of activities. The first type of activity will focus on the  manufacturing and characterization of composite laminates geared toward  the aerospace industry. Effects of different parameters—such as the  speed of manufacturing, the temperature and pressure on the quality of  the laminates—will be studied. The second type of activity will be on  the development of composite structural components that have been made  using other manufacturing techniques—such as hand lay-up/autoclave and  liquid composite moulding. Comparison will be made on the performance of  composite components made using the different techniques. The third  type of activity will be on the development of new and novel composite  structural components that can only be made using AFP. The performance  of these composite structural components will be evaluated.The Chair  results will have a strong impact on the technological advance for the  industrial partners, to a leading position of Canadian technology, and  will contribute to the improvement of socio-economic conditions in  Canada. Over the past few years, composites have been used extensively  for the manufacturing of lightweight structures—such as aircrafts,  automobiles, wind turbines, and sports equipment. The use of automation  will enhance the speed of production, improve the quality of parts,  enhance the performance, and reduce waste; thus helping to improve the  environment. Automated composites manufacturing will also provide a more  level playing field for manufacturing of composites from low  labour-cost countries and high labour-cost countries, thus helping to  keep manufacturing jobs in Canada. Lighter aircrafts would also reduce  fuel consumption, thus helping to protect the environment. Faster  production would reduce manufacturing costs and produce more  competitiveness for the companies.
Canada Research Chairs
Dr. V. Chvatal: Combinatorial Optimization
In the 1990s, Dr. Vaclav Chvatal and three collaborators developed a  computer code for solving certain instances of the traveling salesman  problem. One in particular involved 15,112 cities in Germany. These  groundbreaking algorithmic techniques have the potential of being  applied to a wide class of combinatorial optimization problems, where  one aims to find the most economical option among a finite, but often  astronomically large, number of possibilities. Classical applications of  combinatorial optimization problems have been found in industrial and  management planning. The Internet Revolution and recent advances in  genomics, largely dominate recent applications. They include broadband  satellite communications, computational finance, and biotechnology.  These areas will provide test beds for software developed by Dr. Chvatal  and his research team.
Dr. R. Glitho: End-User Service Engineering for Communications Networks
End-user services (e.g. Multimedia and multiparty games, distance  learning, video on demand) are the raison d’être of communications  networks. The specification and validation of architectures for end-user  services in communication networks is a major engineering challenge.  The widest possible range of services needs to be engineered; all the  phases of the life cycle (e.g. development, deployment, execution, usage  and withdrawal) need to be addressed; and the specifics of the  communications networks need to be taken into account. This research  program focus on specification and validation of comprehensive  architectures (e.g. concepts, principles, rules) for engineering  end-user services in communications networks. The program draws on  several disciplines (e.g. distributed systems, software engineering,  networking) and deals with both conventional networks (e.g. 3G) and  challenged networks (e.g. mobile ad hoc networks, wireless sensors and  actuators networks).
Dr. A. Kishk: Advanced Antenna Systems
Dr Kishk's goal is to  develop miniaturized antennas for smart phones  that cover multiple frequency  bands and can harvest solar energy to  recharge batteries. He is also investigating how to produce affordable,  anti-collision radars for vehicles and  microwave sensors for biomedical  applications in cancer detection.
Dr. Y. Zeng: Design Science
Dr. Zeng's research aims at developing robust software tools to enhance  the quality and efficiency of innovative product development in  manufacturing companies. The foundation of these tools is the formal  design science he has developed based on the recursive logic of design  he proposed with his collaborator in 1991. His research includes design  process modeling, requirements engineering, design knowledge  representation, surface reconstruction, as well as finite element  modeling. He has applied his research results to some industry projects,  such as intelligent sketching interface for product conceptual design,  integrated CAD/FEM radar analysis system, etc. Dr. Zeng and his team are  currently exploring the applications of their software tools to  manufacturing industry such as aerospace engineering, automotive  engineering, and biomedical devices manufacturing.
Concordia University Research Chairs
Dr. A. Athienitis: Integration of Solar Energy Systems into Buildings
Integration of solar energy systems into buildings has the potential to  convert them into net energy producers on an annual basis. The challenge  is to develop such buildings as advanced technological systems that are  affordable and comfortable through optimal integration of passive  systems and energy generating technologies such as photovoltaics, as  well as energy efficiency technologies. Dr Athienitis’ research work  focuses on the study, modeling and development of innovative solar  systems such as building-integrated photovoltaic/thermal systems which  generate electricity and useful heat while being a functional part of  the building envelope and its energy system; model-based design and  control of daylighting systems that include motorized shading and  transparent photovoltaics; modeling, design and control of net-zero  energy buildings. Dr. Athienitis founded the NSERC Solar Buildings  Research Network with its base at Concordia and pioneered several world  class demonstration projects of solar homes with near-zero average  annual energy consumption.  He was named by Actualité Magazine as one of  25 top innovators in Quebec.
Dr. M. Debbabi: Information Systems Security
With  the striking expansion of  information technology, security is  emerging as the most important  challenge  facing computer science and  engineering. Individuals, corporations and  organizations are relying  more and more on information systems that are  connected to public  networks, to transmit confidential and  security-critical  data. This  trend has increased the risks of interception, malicious   instrumentation and misuse of sensitive electronic information.   Accordingly,  information systems must be protected against any  malicious attempt  that may  affect secrecy (by leaking sensitive  information), integrity (by  corrupting  information), authentication  (by impersonating authorized principals),  availability (by denying  service to legal users), etc. The negative  impacts of  this situation  include: loss or endangerment of human life, financial  loss,  unauthorized  use or misuse of information, denial of services,  alteration and/or  compromise  of data or software. Our research aims at  creating dedicated processes,  methodologies, techniques and tools to  prevent attacks, reduce  vulnerabilities,  and mitigate the underlying  risks and forensically investigate cyber  incidents.
Dr. T. Eavis: Online Analytical Processing for Tera-scale Parallel Databases
Today, many of the world's largest databases are, in fact, data  warehouses. By integrating detailed, transactional data from across the  enterprise, organizations are able to assess historical trends and plan  for the future. With the emergence of the web, however, warehouse data  volumes have grown to the point where traditional warehouse  architectures often fail to provide the kind of real time performance  that today's interactive users typically demand. Dr. Eavis' current work  focuses on a pair of related goals. In the first case, his research lab  is investigating methods that will support more intuitive analytical  services on top of the underlying warehouse repositories. Such  functionality is often broadly described by the term Online Analytical  Processing (OLAP). Specific research themes include visualization,  object oriented query facilities, query optimization, and  multi-dimensional caching. At the same time, he is targeting high  performance architectures, with a particular emphasis on cluster  computing, multi-core algorithms, and distributed grid architectures.
Dr. S.V. Hoa: Materials & Composites
Research work on Materials and Composites places emphasis on the  developments of new products, processes and technologies and looking at  quality and performance issues (fracture toughness, resistance against  the absorption of small molecules such as water, alkali-water solution  and oxygen, flammability resistance) and making them more cost effective  for industrial applications be it in aerospace, automotive, biomedical  or civil engineering structures. Currently, Dr. Hoa, a leading expert in  his field of study, is focused on advances in polymer nanocomposites,  long fiber thermoplastic composites, nanomechanics of polymeric  materials, shrinkage of resin, and intelligent materials.
Dr. C. Mulligan: Environmental Engineering
Minimization and avoidance of pollutant releases and understanding the  movement and transformation of contaminants once they reach the  environment, are required to avoid the degradation of the environment  and hence the ecosystem. The increasing population is leading to fewer  waste management options, environmental destruction, and increased  disasters due to global warming. Environmental management and  technological development will ultimately enhance the quality of life of  the public and the quality of the environment for the entire ecosystem.  Through this research program, Dr. Mulligan looks to develop  technologies for the treatment of air, water, waste and soil  contaminants, as well as investigate the processes for the transport and  degradation of chemicals in the complete environment across all media.
Dr. S. Rakheja: Vehicular Ergodynamics
Concordia has long been known for its expertise in advanced  transportation systems and highway safety, human response to workplace  vibration and driver-vehicle interaction. Dr. Rakheja’s research work in  this area has evolved to what is called vehicular ergodynamics, a field  that involves systematic studies on the dynamics of the transport  system on the human operator, with a special emphasis on dynamic  environmental interactions. Ergodynamics addresses the mutual adaptation  of the system and the human operator, to enhance system performance and  optimal efficiency with appropriate considerations of the performance  limits of the operator. The research efforts are directed towards  developments in theories on human perception and response; effective  objective and subjective measurement techniques; considerations of  various human (age, gender, anthropometry, anthropodynamics, and  neuro-muscular response) and environmental (visibility and road  conditions) factors; vehicle dynamics and highway safety; dynamic  driver-vehicle-environment interactions; and intelligent vehicles.
Dr. C. Y. Suen: Artificial Intelligence & Pattern Recognition
Recognition technologies play an important role in information processing. Each day, billions of business and financial documents have to be processed by computers. Data needs to be captured from these documents and entered for processing. Because of the lack of computerized handwriting recognition machines, most of this data, be it an amount on a cheque or postal code, have to be entered into the computer by tedious, slow, and costly manual operations. The objective of Dr. Suen, world-renowned in his field, is to integrate several promising recognition methods, and at the same time, develop robust techniques, while discovering and applying new perceptual knowledge to improve and optimize character recognition schemes. The long-term goal is to produce an optical character and word recognition (OCR or OWR) system, which will ultimately outperform or be at least comparable to the capability of human vision.
Dr. C-Y. Su: Intelligent Control of Non-Smooth Dynamic Systems
The phenomenon of wing rock or limit-cycle oscillation that normally  occurs in aircraft is mainly due to mechanical backlash, dead zone and  hysteresis. This phenomenon is of great concern in the aerospace  industry. Extensive research has been carried out to find means of  controlling this unwanted oscillation. Mechanical backlash, dead-zone  and hysteresis that generate such oscillations fall into the general  category of non-smooth nonlinearities. They are common in the industrial  controls systems, ranging from high-technology applications  (micromanipulation in fabrication of semiconductors, ultra-precision  turning of turbine shafts, micro-stabbers and micropipettes in cellular  biology) to traditional applications (robot manipulators, and drive  systems of large vehicles). Dr. Su’s plans are to develop control  theories, engineering design methods and technology for non-smoooth  dynamic systems, arising from parameter variations or from neglected  dynamics.
The development of control methods have a direct impact on the  products being produced, and are suitable for any motion systems with  mechanical connections, hydraulic servo-valves, piezoelectric actuators,  electric servomotors, and biomedical actuator systems that require fast  and precision control.
Dr. M. Swamy: Signal Processing & Applications
Digital signal processing techniques have found a variety of  applications over the last 15 to 20 years in the processing of signals  in such diverse areas as biomedical image processing,  telecommunications, acoustics, image and video signal processing and  seismology. The overall objective of Dr. Swamy’s research is to develop  fundamental underlying theory for efficient and reliable processing of  speech, image and video signals, and to design algorithms for their  software and hardware implementation for communication and other  applications. Some of his current research projects include;  low-complexity speech coding; silent suppression techniques for packet  voice communication; voice activity detection using higher-order  statistics; echo cancellation, de-noising and compression of digital  images; error resilient video coding algorithms and their performance  evaluation; robust watermarking techniques using wavelets; and the  development of efficient multidimensional vector radix algorithms.
Dr. S. Tahar: Formal Verification of Microelectronic Systems
The revolution of information technology and electronics in general, is  driven by the extraordinary advances in semiconductor technology.  Today’s microelectronics systems are complex designs with literally tens  of millions of transistors on a single chip, often combining  microcontroller and DSP processor cores, memory blocks, application  specific logic and mixed-signal functions. Complexity, time-to-market  pressure and evolving requirements pose new challenges in the design and  verification process. Traditional testing such as simulation methods,  can no longer give reasonable assurance for the quality of a product.  Dr. Tahar’s research aims to develop techniques and tools enabling the  verification of real-size microelectronics designs through alternative  means, called formal methods, involving all possible scenarios of input  and state combinations, giving very strong results about the correctness  of designs. The proposed techniques will be validated using real  designs, which are industrial benchmarks. This approach will advance the  systems specification and verification process, thus shortening the  design cycle of microelectronics products.

Dr. A. Ghrayeb: High-Speed Wireless Communications
Providing  reliable, high-speed wireless links has been a challenging  task due to the  unfriendly nature of wireless channels and the scarcity  of resources such as  frequency spectrum. Over the last decade or so,  we have witnessed a number of ground-breaking  innovations that led to  overcoming some of those challenges and forming the  nucleus of  international standards for future wireless networks such as 4G and   WiMax. However, there are still hurdles along the way to achieving the  full  potential of such networks. Another adversity of wireless systems  is the lack  of secured transmission, which poses a major obstacle for  many wireless  applications from maturing and realizing what current  technologies promise. Dr.  Ghrayeb's work focuses on developing coding  and signal processing strategies  that aim at improving the performance  of wireless systems and bridging the gap  between theory and practice.  He has been engaged in a number of multi-million  dollar projects with  collaborators from around the world. Some of the projects  he has been  involved in include cellular networks, underwater acoustic   communications, cognitive networks, and communication security.

Dr. K. Khorasani: Control of Autonomous Network of Unmanned Systems
The objectives of the proposed research are to provide  enhanced  capabilities to the command and control operators, and ultimately for   fully autonomous on-board systems in determining the most efficient  allocation,  configuration, strategies, and architectures for  cooperative fault diagnosis  and control of a network of unmanned  vehicles (UVs). The fundamental challenges  and issues envisaged are  development of novel, formal, and rigorous distributed  and  semi-decentralized methodologies for management and determination of   exchange of data, knowledge, and actions among the team of cooperating  UVs.  These goals are to be accomplished by utilizing control theories  that are  constrained by the communication network and computational  resources for  cooperative fault diagnosis and cooperative recovery and  reconfiguration  control objectives that are subject to real-time  constraints for guaranteeing  and maintaining the mission requirements.  The expected outcomes of this project will provide  rigorous solutions  to practical problems of paramount importance that is of  significant  interest to the space, robotics, marine, and aerospace industries  and  will accumulate human capital and develop sustainable research   capabilities.

Dr. M. Paraschivoiu: Simulation of Clean Energy Production and Storage
Simulation of Clean Energy Production and Storage aims at developing  Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) algorithms to accurately simulate the  flow in the area of wind energy and hydrogen storage.  The objectives  of the wind energy research are the development of a CFD tool that  accurately captures the physics of the flow around multiple vertical  axis wind turbines (VAWT), the analysis of the fundamental mechanisms  that increase the power coefficient of multiple VAWTs and the  demonstration of the energy extraction benefit of placing VAWTs close  together to increase the extraction of wind energy.
The main drawback with the current CFD approaches is the inability of  the CFD-RANS to capture the physics of flows which involves laminar to  turbulent boundary layer transition leading to a separation bubble.  Currently only LES solvers are able to simulate this flow but this  approach is not feasible for multiple VAWTs as it is too computationally  expensive. The ability to capture or model dynamic stall and the wake  behind the turbine needs to be developed in an RANS model.
In the area of hydrogen jets, Dr.Paraschivoiu’s research group has  developed a CFD code to examine real gas effects at high pressures when  hydrogen is released from a high-pressure chamber. The code is based on a  3-D finite volume Euler/Navier-Stokes solver, and a transport equation  is used to simulate the hydrogen concentration into air. To model  turbulence, we have developed a new adaptive upwinding scheme for Large  Eddy Simulations that works well for compressible flows. Recently, by  implementing a moving mesh methodology we have investigated the flow  behavior of jets through orifices that can change shape dynamically.
