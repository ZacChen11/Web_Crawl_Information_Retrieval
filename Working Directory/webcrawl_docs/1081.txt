What our students and alumni say about the GDBA Advantage
As a summer intern at United Rentals, I was introduced to the key necessities to operate a successful enterprise: hard work and dedication. I adopted a vast amount of knowledge working in both sales and management all the while learning the importance of leadership and positive workplace relationships. One of the company’s core values is their dedication to their clientele and employees which explains why they are the largest equipment rental company in North America. Throughout my internship, I have had the support and guidance of my colleagues which has encouraged and taught me to strive and contribute my absolute best. Thank you JMSB for assisting me in finding this incredible opportunity.
Melissa Petosa
2nd year GDBA student
When I decided to pursue a formal business education to complement my professional experience and develop my managerial skills, I had no doubt that the GDBA was the right choice for me because of JMSB’s great reputation.
Being both challenged and supported, enabled me to achieve my best and to strive to be better. The amazing exchanges with professors, career advisors and peers not only developed my analytical thinking and a management skill set, but also expanded my professional network, and added wonderful people to my circle of friends.

GDBA '16
Product and Production Manager - Hasbro
Concordia's GDBA/GCBA program offers an excellent crash-course into the world of business, regardless of your background. When I enrolled, it had been over 10 years since I had studied anything outside of the health science field!
The program offers flexibility to accommodate different schedules, and covers the spectrum of business elements, from marketing to accounting, as well as teaching “soft skills”. What most struck me about the program was how the content is transferable to various facets of your life – you don’t need to be in business to do business!
Whether it is improving your communication skills with coworkers or family members, or just better managing your own personal budget, the GCBA/GDBA curriculum offers far-reaching benefits. Of course, the reality is that many careers do come in contact with elements of business administration, so the certificate or diploma from JMSB can directly impact your professional development as well!
Every course I took has in some way influenced my behaviour in both my personal and professional life. I’m proud to support these programs, and encourage others to consider enrolling!
