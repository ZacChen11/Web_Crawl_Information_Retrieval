CSU Special Clubs Funding
Who can apply? Student clubs that are registered with the CSU and who are recognized as active by the Dean of Students Office.
What is the fund’s mandate? To provide funding for CSU Clubs who wish to develop a new initative not included in their approved annual budget.
What expenses can/n’t you apply for? It broadly funds projects oriented towards the Concordia community, with an emphasis placed on how the proposed projects will enhance student life. However, it does not fund competitions, conferences, or salaries.  All funding is provided to projects in the form of expense reimbursements. Approved projects will be required to submit ORIGINAL receipts for all requisitioned expenditures. 
How much can you apply for? Projects can be awarded up to $5,000 depending on their scope. 
What is the application process? Applicants must fill out the Special Clubs Funding Application Form  about their project and include a detailed budget and any potential promotional materials.
Application Deadline: No set deadline. The Clubs and Space Committee reviews SCF applications during their meetings which take place approximately once per month throughout the year. Applications should be submitted as far in advance as possible.
 
Please  contact the CSU Internal Affairs Coordinator (clubs@csu.qc.ca)  or the CSU Clubs Director (clubsdirector@csu.qc.ca) should you have any questions regarding your application.
