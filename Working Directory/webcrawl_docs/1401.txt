A PLACE TO CULTIVATE NEXT-GENERATION TALENT
Key priorities to prepare leaders for a world that, in many ways, will be dramatically different from today’s.
RESEARCH AWARDS
More and more, undergraduate students are looking to participate in research. Through research awards, we’re enabling research experiences for this cohort that complement coursework and can be carried forward into the graduate level.
FIELD SCHOOLS
Off-campus projects that mobilize students from across disciplines to provide a real-world solution are part of our vision for preparing next-generation talent. By supporting field schools, we will challenge students to engage with community partners, perform hands-on work and apply active problem solving.
GRADUATE AWARDS
Close to 8,000 graduate students are enrolled at Concordia today — double our cohort from just 10 years ago. They drive research, help retain top faculty, boost Concordia’s profile and attract additional research funds. Supporting their efforts is paramount.
ENTREPRENEURSHIP ZONE
Named the best startup accelerator in Quebec, Concordia’s District 3 Innovation Center helps students turn an idea into a prototype for a new product or service. Supporting D3’s growth will enable more student ventures, private investment and partnerships with small- to medium-sized enterprises.
UNDERGRADUATE AWARDS
Increasingly, applicants list one of our 500 programs as their first choice for study. Access to financial awards, however, is one of the biggest determining factors in a prospective student’s choice of where to study. We’re working to provide more funding that will enable young minds to gain a Concordia education.
SKILLS AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
Whether students are in first year, graduate studies or continuing ed, they need to build their professional toolkit, find tutors and organize study groups or workshops. By investing in our state-of-the-art Student Success Centre and GradProSkills, we can help them in each step of their journey.
REAL-WORLD EXPERIENCE
Concordia’s reputation for co-operative learning is among the best. More than 1,800 students from 40 programs take part in our co-operative learning each year — up by 63 per cent from just six years ago. As Canada’s next-generation university, we’re intent on helping all students to gain invaluable beyond-the-classroom experience.
ONLINE LEARNING
As one of Canada’s pioneers in the field, Concordia has a solid infrastructure and track record for supporting quality online learning. To continue leading in this arena, we’re developing online graduate diplomas, classes that blend in-person and online learning and Massive Open Online Courses.
STUDENT MOBILITY
We’re committed to opening doors for students to undertake research projects beyond Quebec through Graduate Student Mobility Awards. Our focus on international experience will also be ramped up through Concordia’s Student Exchange Program, which offers opportunities at 150 universities in 35 countries.
