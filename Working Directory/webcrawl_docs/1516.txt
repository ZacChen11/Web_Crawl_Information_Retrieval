DeSève is a 160-seat cinema with an adjacent foyer that is used primarily for Film Studies classes during the school year (September to April), but is available to clients on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, as well as throughout the summer. Film festivals, panel discussions and presentations are hosted in this cinema.

FAQ
Is this venue appropriate for a movie screening, lecture, or conference?
Yes, the cinema is equipped to screen film, high-definition video, and digital cinema formats (2K). It can also support PowerPoint presentations and panel discussions.
This room has two teaching podia, one located at the front-left of the cinema (as seen by the audience) and one in the centre of the room on the far left side. Microphone, standard AV connections, and reading lights are located at both podia. The front podium also has a 20" touchscreen computer monitor, providing the ability to annotate on-screen.
Is there a stage in DeSève?
There is a small stage (approximately 9 by 33 feet) in front of the screen, which is suitable for tables for a panel discussion.
The cinema is not suitable for theatre and dance productions. When using the stage, it is important that the cinema screen is not touched, as the oils on a person's hands cannot be washed off the surface.
The Public Address (P.A.) system in the cinema should not be used to amplify musical instruments. If you are planning a musical performance, a separate amplification system including speakers should be rented for this purpose.
Is the cinema available all the time?
The DeSève Cinema is used primarily for Film Studies classes during the school year (September to April), but is available to clients on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, as well as throughout the summer. A few blocks of time may also be open during the week depending on the academic schedule. Visit our  Availability Calendar  to see when the cinema may be reserved.
Do I require a technician or projectionist at my event?
Almost all bookings at DeSève Cinema require a projectionist or technician, since all technical aspects are controlled from inside the projection booth, which is off-limits to non-authorized personnel. The projectionist or technician will also function as your liaison for any inquiries that may arise while using the venue.
Can I book tables, chairs, tablecloths, or a podium for the cinema?
Extra furniture can be requested when booking the cinema. Certain fees may apply for the delivery and set-up of this furniture. Some set-ups may have to be done by Custodial Services, who require a minimum of 48-hours' notice for furniture delivery.  
You may book any of the following:
Tables
Chairs
Easels
Poster (bulletin) boards
Stage podium
Tablecloths (rented for $8 each)
DeSève is already equipped with a teaching podium at audience level, which is appropriate for PowerPoint presentations and lectures.
Does the foyer next to the cinema have to be booked or does it come with the cinema booking?
It is generally assumed that a cinema booking will incorporate the use of the foyer area, which includes washrooms. The space comes equipped with a screen, data projector and audio capabilities for small receptions or presentations, and the associated charges are $100/day. The foyer cannot be rented separately from the cinema during class time or during bookings that are not using the space. Standing capacity is approximately 50 persons. Speak with the Booking Coordinator regarding your plans for the use of the foyer.
Can we have a reception in the foyer and bring food and drink?
If you are planning an event that involves food and/or alcoholic beverages you must inform the booking coordinator at the time of your initial booking request. Familiarize yourself with Concordia’s policies relating to food and alcohol service on campus by consulting the event planning page . The booking coordinator will also be happy to explain these policies and procedures to you.
For catered food, choose a caterer from the University’s  approved caterer list .
For self-catered food, complete and submit a waiver to the booking coordinator at the time of your booking request. This form must include a detailed list of all the items you are planning to make available to your guests.
For alcohol, complete and submit the  alcohol waiver to the booking coordinator.
These waiver forms help to determine if you require government permits for your event. The booking coordinator will assist you in obtaining any necessary permits.
Please note that Custodial Services may be required for events that involve food or alcohol. This service will be applied at the discretion of the booking coordinator. Custodial charges will be applied for cleaning done on evenings (Monday to Thursday) or weekends (Friday to Sunday). Do not hesitate to ask for a quote that includes custodial services.
For weekend events, custodial services staff is billed at the overtime rate.
Can I book the Atrium of the Library Building?
The Atrium is booked through Hospitality Concordia (848-2424 ext. 4999,  booking@concordia.ca ).
Are there electrical outlets available in the cinema?
Yes, there are double duplex outlets located under every second seat inside the theatre and several along the outer walls. There are two single outlets onstage, spaced 15 feet apart. Power is also available at both teaching podia.
There are two 15A circuits at the back of the room, which are suitable for spotlights (each duplex is located at a height of approximately 50 inches). Two Leko theatre lights may be provided upon request. There is also a vertical lighting bracket located next to each outlet. If additional theatre lights are required, clients must provide and operate them. At this time, the cinema is not equipped with dimmers or a theatrical lighting control board.

Booking policy
Making a reservation for J.A. DeSève Cinema
Although information may be exchanged over the phone or in person, all requests and/or changes to a booking must be made via email in order to preserve the order of all requests, and to document the progress of each booking.
After discussion of available dates and times in the cinema, the IITS Cinemas Booking Coordinator will direct the client to the DeSève Cinema Availability Calenda r. The client follows the instructions to find availability and access the online reservation form. The reservation form, when submitted, is automatically sent to the Booking Coordinator.
Upon receipt, the reservation form will be processed and the Booking Coordinator will confirm (unofficially) that the room has been reserved. Technical and logistical details will be finalized before an estimate is sent.
If the reservation is for an internal department/group, official confirmation of the event would be pending receipt of a budget code.
If the reservation is external, the client will be asked to sign a lease agreement, and also pay the total estimated amount in advance, before receiving official confirmation. In instances where the total estimated amount of the bill is greater than $2500, a down payment of 50% of the total, or the total estimated labour charges (whichever is greater) will be necessary to confirm the booking. The balance of the amount owed will be due no later than 30 days after receipt of invoice. After the event has taken place, the client will be notified of any discrepancy between the estimated amount and the actual usage (i.e the event went longer or shorter than estimated, the client asked for extra equipment, etc.), and billed accordingly.
Tentative reservations
Clients may make tentative reservations that will be converted to confirmed bookings when the client confirms the date. A client with a tentative reservation will be asked to confirm or release the booking if another client requests the tentatively-reserved date. In this case, a hold on this date would require a non-refundable payment of 50% of the estimated room rental fee or $100, whichever amount is higher.  
Deposits for multiple-date reservations
An external client who books DeSève Cinema for more than 2 days (e.g. a film festival or conference) will be asked to make a non-refundable deposit for the event. The amount will be 50% of the estimated room rental fee (not projectionist or equipment), plus taxes.  
Late booking requests and cancellations
Requests must be made a minimum of 10 business days before the event. A booking may be cancelled without penalty up to 5 business days before the event, except for cases requiring a non-refundable deposit.
The client will be charged the room fee noted in the booking estimate for cancellations made 4 business days or less before the event.
A booking made at the minimum time allowed (10 business days or one calendar week) or less before the event CANNOT be cancelled. The required pre-payment is not refundable.
Policy on sponsoring external organizations
An internal client (faculty, staff, or student organization) sponsored by a department must provide the email address of the person with budget code signing authority before confirmation of the booking request.
External clients are charged external rates. Internal departments are free to sponsor external clients, though this sponsorship means only that the department will be paying the external client's invoice using a departmental budget code. Internal departments are free to sponsor an external group by paying all, or a percentage of, the client’s invoice. Students cannot sponsor external groups or organizations.
Policy concerning advertising and signage/poster display
All advertising and promotional material for any event booked in DeSève Cinema cannot state or imply that Concordia University is connected with or endorses the event, unless prior permission has been given by the University. This includes naming Concordia University as part of the location address for the event. Contact the Booking Coordinator for assistance on this topic.
All signs, posters, or banners advertising an event booked in DeSève Cinema must not be placed on the exterior of any public building or on any lamppost, tree, or other object not specifically designated for public advertisements. The University reserves the right to disclose to municipal authorities the identity of the client of the event if the University is contacted about illegal signage/poster display.
Policy concerning insurance
Concordia University currently requires external clients who book venues on campus to have (or to procure) a public liability insurance policy in the amount of $2,000,000. Concordia University must be named as "additionally co-insured".
The University, represented by the IITS Booking Coordinator, will require a copy of this insurance policy to finalize any external lease agreement for the rental of the venue. Consult the University’s Policy Governing the Temporary Use of Space for further details.
Contact your Booking Coordinator if you have any questions regarding liability insurance.

Additional rate information
Projectionist labour and equipment time beyond the minimums will be charged at the same rate. This will be detailed in your final invoice.
The projectionist will arrive before show time as noted in the booking details (generally 1 to 2 hours ahead of time as determined by the Booking Coordinator) to set up and check the system. Clients are instructed to meet the projectionist at that time with their media to provide ample time for tests.
External clients are required to provide proof of liability insurance, sign a standard lease agreement, and make payment for the event upfront. The IITS booking coordinator will assist with each step of the process.
Booking categories are applied at the discretion of IITS. We reserve the right to change a client's booking category if the client or event status changes.
No taxes are charged when paid via budget code (internal).
Reduced rates can be discussed for external clients when booking multiple dates.
If additional equipment is required (i.e. laptop, microphones, etc.), further rental fees may apply.
Notes:
Although information may be exchanged over the phone or in person, all requests and/or changes must be made via email in order to document the progress of each booking, and to preserve the order of all requests.
An internal client (faculty, staff or student group) who is sponsored by a department must provide the email address of the person with budget code authority before confirmation of their booking request.
External clients are charged external rates. Internal departments are free to sponsor external clients, however this sponsorship means only that the department will be paying the external client's invoice by budget code.
Students cannot sponsor external groups or organizations.
Booking policy
The VA-114 teaching cinema, located in the Fine Arts building at 1395 Blvd. Rene-Levesque West was renovated in the summer of 2012. The cinema seats an audience of 94 and features a ceiling-mounted projector for self-serve classroom support in addition to a Christie digital HD3K projector housed in the projection booth for cinema screenings, serviced by trained technicians. In addition to the video equipment, the cinema supports celluloid projection, both 16 & 35mm. In VA-114, the primary mandate is the support of academic activities; however, the cinema has become increasingly popular with cinema clubs and small festivals outside of the academic schedule, given its location and the professional level of audio-visual equipment offered.
