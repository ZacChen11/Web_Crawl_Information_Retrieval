Registration dates
Winter 2018 – November 27, 2017
For newly authorized undergraduate Independent Students.
Independent student overview
As an Independent Undergraduate Student, you do not seek a Degree or Certificate. You register in individual courses on a part-time basis (maximum of 9 credits per term).
Depending on your goals, you may use Independent Status to explore different fields of study, to raise your Grade Point Average (GPA) or to complete prerequisites courses for admission to a bachelor’s degree. 
Admissions requirements
You can apply to become an Independent Undergraduate Student if:
You are 21 years of age or older and are Canadian or a Permanent Resident.
OR
You are under 21 years of age and are Canadian or a Permanent Resident and you meet the University’s minimum academic admission requirements .
OR
You are an International student already in Montreal and you meet the University’s minimum international admission requirements .
Note: International Independent Student status is not intended for foreigners applying from abroad because this status may not enable you to obtain the required Study Permit and CAQ to study in Canada. Refer to Immigration Regulations  for more information.
Find out more about  criteria for admission and required supporting documents  for Independent Status.

International Independent Students must refer to their Offer of Admission for more information about registering for courses.
Courses with prerequisites: Independent students must prove to the University that they have completed all required prerequisite courses. In these cases, you must complete a "Prerequisite Waiver" form , and in some cases, you must visit the academic department offering the desired course directly to ask for a prerequisite waiver.

Applying to an undergraduate program after Independent Status
If you are an Independent Student who subsequently wishes to enter a bachelor's or certificate program, go here to start your application . Double check that you have met all of the Admission Requirements by referring to the Recommended Courses  section of this website, by double checking your Program of Interest’s Admission Requirements or by speaking to an Academic Advisor .
In some cases, credits you earned as an Independent Student can be applied towards a degree or certificate program, if they are appropriate. The number of credits you receive will depend on the program and the Faculty. For instance, in the case of the Faculty of Arts and Science, an Independent Student may be granted a maximum of 30 credits towards their degree.
Independent graduate students may enrol in a particular graduate course, without being admitted to the graduate program that offers the courses. Follow these steps to apply for an independent course(s):
1. Contact the  Graduate Program Assistant to determine if that program accepts independent students.
2. Review course descriptions in the Graduate Calendar and choose the course(s) that interest you.
3. Complete the graduate Authorization to Register as a Non-Degree Student form.
4. Submit the completed form to the Graduate Program Assistant of the graduate program that offers the course. You must also submit a copy of your most recent transcript (student copies are acceptable) and appropriate proof of residency.
5. Read the complete information on   Independent Graduate Students  in the Graduate Calendar.
Upon receipt of all the required documents, the Graduate Program Director will evaluate the applicant’s academic credentials to determine if the applicant is qualified to take the graduate course(s).
Independent graduate students register for courses after degree students enrol and are not guaranteed a place in a course.
Limit on course registration
Independent graduate students take no more than the equivalent of two graduate courses per term and up to a maximum of 12 credits from a specific program. Independent students are classified as graduate part-time students.
After you are accepted
Permanent Code
As per the Ministry of Education, all students are required to have a permanent code in order to study in Québec. Students who do not have a permanent code will be charged an additional fee for their courses. To avoid the additional charge, applicants must make the necessary arrangements to obtain a permanent code .
