Conditional admission

With a conditional offer, you will start in the Intensive English Language Program (IELP), where you will develop the English skills necessary to enter university studies. You must attain a final grade of 70% or higher at the Advanced 2 Level to meet Concordia language proficiency requirements. All students who have obtained a final grade of 70% or higher at the Advanced Level will take a placement test to determine if additional academic English classes are necessary. If required, the additional courses will be taken concurrently with your chosen academic program. English credit courses may count toward degree programs, with the exception of ENCS programs. Visit study-english-at-concordia.ca .
You may also choose to retake your language test before beginning the IELP. If your new results meet Concordia’s proficiency requirements, you may begin your academic program directly.

All programs in the Faculty of Fine Arts
In the Faculty of Arts and Science: All Honours programs; all programs offered by the Departments of Applied Human Sciences, Communication Studies, Education, English, Journalism, Liberal Arts College, Science College; Traduction; Actuarial Mathematics/Finance; Math and Computational Finance; Community, Public Affairs and Policy Studies; Certificate in Pastoral Ministry; Exercise Science
