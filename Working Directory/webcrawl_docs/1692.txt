The Perfect Pitch
Presented by by Sherin Al-Safadi, MSc, MBA, PhD
Download: "The Perfect Pitch: 3 Steps, 3 Minutes"
Listen to the podcast:
What is an example of a good closing for a perfect pitch?
1. If you have time for a discussion after your pitch (ideal):
Close the pitch by asking something about themselves/their company.
Do your research beforehand and try and come up with something interesting (as opposed to "so I understand your company provides 'x' and 'y' services?). This will turn the conversation back to them, allow you both to engage in an open-ended, less-rigid discussion, and it also shows your ability to not only present yourself, but also your eagerness to want to gain a deeper understanding and interest in the audience. Give your full attention when listening and keep the conversation going by continuing to ask questions.
2. In the case that you are being shepherded out the door after the pitch because of time constraints (less ideal):
Close the pitch by ending with a direct call to action.
Re-emphasize your eagerness to join the team (or otherwise depending on your objective ), then encourage them to contact you, give you their business card or book a follow-up meeting right away.
— Sherin Al-Safadi, MBA 10, PhD 14
Improve your LinkedIn profile
Whether you’re looking to fine-tune your profile or are new to the platform, this checklist will help you present yourself thoroughly and professionally.

Digital Networking & Branding for Jobs
These hands-on lessons for full-time job seekers, as well as those looking to advance their career to the next level, showed how to use digital media to generate job and career opportunities. Presented by Julian Gay-de-Montella, Digital Skills Foundation.
Download the presentation: "Digital Networking & Branding for Jobs"
Listen to the podcast:
How do you use Twitter to network?
First decide what your networking goal is:
brand yourself and connect?
acquire clients?
looking for potential employment ?
While the strategy varies depending on your goal, the simple response is to make sure your profile is complete and follow people of interest strategically. This means first understanding what is important to them. Observe what subjects they discuss and they actively engage in, visit their company page and follow anyone they actively follow themselves. Once your understanding is solid, engage them in a more relevant way.
Start by sharing their Tweets, RT'ing and most of all, adding comments of value. (ie. sharing ideas, links, events, constructive suggestions).
After a certain time, you could "@"directly their Twitter handle if you want to prompt them for a response. Use this carefully but it works if your question is appropriate and helpful. Or better, once you've established a certain relation with them, feel free to craft a short but pointed direct Twitter message. The beauty of Twitter is that many decision makers spend time on this platform and there is more of an etiquette around responding. 
— Julian Gay-de-Montella, Digital Skills Foundation
Are graduation portraits appropriate for LinkedIn profile pictures?
Since your goal is getting hired (or at least get to the interview stage) you will want to portray yourself as a professional and someone of interest.
You are more likely to get interest from recruiters with a professional photo rather than one that conveys recent grad status. 
Imagine yourself already with the job and being chosen to be on their website or promotional poster. This picture is ideal and the one you want on your profile.
— Julian Gay-de-Montella, Digital Skills Foundation
How does Facebook affect job searches?
In North America (and possibly the United Kingdom and Australia) recruiters may have a look at your Facebook profile to make sure you are socially acceptable or not compromising to them in a professional sense. Outside of North America, this practice is minimal to non-existent. 
Remember Facebook details do appear in search engine results so:
be mindful of what you post on any social media and
restrict your privacy settings so that if you appear in search engines you control who gets to see your profile and what's in it. 
Regarding job searches, Facebook is trying to grow into a competitor of LinkedIn with solutions for business and business profiles. Where job searchers can make inroads is by engaging company profiles on FB. Nearly every company has a presence and often provides posts, ads, events that can be engaged with. If you offer value in these situations you could potentially attract the company's attention.
— Julian Gay-de-Montella, Digital Skills Foundation
Is it important to have a profile picture on Facebook? 
If you intend to use Facebook as a tool to get potential job offers or personal branding, then use a good profile picture and fill out your bio.
If you use Facebook for personal activity then it is completely your choice. I use Facebook for mostly personal activity but do have a good profile picture and I am mindful of my content since many people do check my profile.
— Julian Gay-de-Montella, Digital Skills Foundation
Managing your Finances
Presented by Elaine Duranceau, TD Bank
Listen to the podcast:
Does loading money onto a credit card for an upcoming purchase affect credit rating?
No. The Credit Bureau tracks only:
requesting more credit
paying within the statement time frame (or not) 
the amount being paid
how close to the credit limit you are keeping your balance
— Elaine Duranceau, TD Bank
 
What resources are there for keeping track of finances?
If you are a TD customer, your personal easyweb page has button at the bottom of the page that allows you to download your spending and statements into a software that will help you determine your spending.
There are many tools on www.tdcanadatrust.com  that can help guide you as to how to organize your documents, do a cash flow calculation and plan for any life event there could be.
If you want software that pulls yours finances from several banks and puts them all in one, there are many that can help.  I have personally used Mint.com. You can always use trusty Google to look at other websites/softwares that can help with this same function.
— Elaine Duranceau, TD Bank

Listen to the podcast:
How do I manage health issues while looking for a job?
It depends on the nature of the health issue (chronic illness, inclusive employers, accommodations, etc.) but here are some ways to manage. 
A CAPS Career Counsellor can help you draft a career action plan to address any concerns or fears and formulate achievable goals with respect to your health needs. We can help with the job search tools and strategies to make sure you're covering all bases. 
Our Career Advisors can help guide if you have worries about the interview process and manage any discomfort you have (ie: how not to appear anxious or fearful and to have self-confidence in your presentation). 
Depending on the health condition, the Access Centre can point you to provincial support and training that you may not be aware of. 
Finally, job hunting is stressful and tiring at the best of times so it's important not to push yourself too far and to rest without feeling guilty and pressured. Career planning/counselling can help you prioritise and narrow down your search and to learn techniques to help you 'let go' and move on if you don't get one of the opportunities that you really want. 
— Laura Mitchell, Ph.D., Director, Student Success Centre
