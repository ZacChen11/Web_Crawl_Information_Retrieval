Hard work, commitment to excellence and a few sleepless nights — these are just some of the ingredients necessary to be an Arts and Science Scholar .
On October 5, a group of 151 of the best and brightest students from the Faculty of Arts and Science (FAS) were recognized for their exemplary academic achievements.
Concordia's Graham Carr , provost and vice-president of Academic Affairs, and André Roy , dean of FAS, were among those celebrating the students.
The cohort includes those whose grades are in the top one per cent of their respective programs. This year, 90 per cent of Arts and Science Scholars have a GPA of 4.00 or higher, with eight scoring a perfect 4.3.
“This truly is a group of exceptional individuals, one that inspires us in the Faculty of Arts and Science,” said Roy. “I believe that these students represent a new generation of scholar. Their talents go well beyond their academic excellence or their mastery of a field of study; they also engage meaningfully in their community to make a change.” 
Three of this year’s honoured scholars provided a few of their top tips for scholarly success.
David Tagliamonti
Bachelor of Science – Actuarial Mathematics
Member of the Institute for Co-operative Education
Three keys to a good education:
Make a reading/homework/study schedule in week one of your term and stick to it.
Push yourself to ask "why?" This will deepen your understanding of course material.
Stay healthy. Regularly playing a sport or going to the gym will keep your mind sharp and help you stay focused in school.
Two lessons learned at FAS:
A problem often has many solutions. The science is in finding a solution; the art is in finding the best one.
University is a great time to learn from others — not just professors, but fellow students as well.
One piece of advice for other students:
Keep learning long after your formal education comes to an end.
Cristy Vista
Bachelor of Arts – Sociology
Member of the Institute for Co-operative Education
Three keys to a good education:
Listen earnestly to your professors when they give a lecture, and to your colleagues when they share their thoughts. Understanding others can widen our own perspective.
Don't let confusion build up — it can hamper learning. Clarify concepts or processes you don't understand as soon as you hear about them.
Learning should not be a lonely process. When you're having a hard time, ask for help. Concordia has many resources you can tap.
Two lessons learned at FAS:
Information is never neutral. It must not be simply digested, but carefully examined and reflected on.
The world is built in a way that we are unequal and completely reliant on each other. The comforts we may have are at the expense of others, and this makes us our brother’s keeper.
One piece of advice for other students:
Studying to just get the grade can be tedious and off-putting. Relate your coursework to your passions, long-term goals and aspirations. This approach can give you encouragement during difficult times. 
 
Anaele Cuerrier
Bachelor of Arts – Linguistics
Three keys to a good education:
First off, it requires professors that not only teach what they love, but who teach you how to think critically and nurture high-quality ignorance. In other words, they teach you how to express your curiosity in meaningful and practical ways.
A good education is one that helps you develop skills that will serve you throughout your entire life.
Finally, it involves a network of people that constantly encourage and motivate you to thrive.
Two lessons learned at FAS:
There are many resources in place to help us succeed at Concordia. We are fortunate to have advisors, committees and activities for everyone.
I also learned to take classes from different departments. FAS has hundreds of different courses offered. This allows us to view the world from multiple perspectives.
One piece of advice to fellow students:
Be resilient and passionate — the rest will follow!
 
 
Marianne Thériault
Bachelor of Arts – Early Childhood and Elementary Education
Three keys to a good education:
Approach every class — or even every assignment — as an opportunity to learn and grow, instead of as a means to an end.
Do not be afraid of hard work and know that it is worth it in the end.
Be resilient and know that every curveball thrown at you will only make you stronger.
Two lessons learned at FAS:
Develop a strong network of colleagues and friends in your field of study.
Learn to challenge your own assumptions and have the courage to step beyond the bounds of normativity.
One piece of advice to fellow students:
Embrace the victory moments. Do not despair during tough times and, most of all, enjoy the amazing journey that education affords.
