Tenure-track position in visual journalism and data negotiation
The Department of Journalism at Concordia University in Montreal, Quebec, invites applications for a full-time tenure track position at the rank of Assistant Professor in VISUAL JOURNALISM AND DATA NEGOTIATION.
We are seeking a practitioner-teacher-scholar with a specialization in visual journalism.

The Department of Journalism has been at the forefront of training skilled journalists who think critically about the profession and society for 40 years. The faculty and staff are committed to serving the profession by training skilled, thinking journalists and by producing scholarship, criticism, and commentary on journalism. Our graduates are nationally recognized journalists striving to fight injustice in a world awash with misinformation. They are known for their intelligence and rigour.
