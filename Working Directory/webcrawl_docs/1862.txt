Tenure-track position in the area of Sensory and Cognitive Aging
Position Description: Concordia University’s Department of Psychology invites applications for a tenure-track position in the area of Sensory and Cognitive Aging. The ideal candidate should be conducting innovative research on sensory loss and cognitive aging. Research could stretch from basic sensory and cognitive processing, to understanding the contributions of sensory loss to cognitive decline, to the development of interventions and adaptive technologies.  This position would build on existing strengths and facilities in the Department of Psychology, the Centre for Research in Human Development , the engAGE Research Centre on Aging, and the PERFORM Centre that are focused on the neurobiology of healthy and pathological aging.  Concordia University provides a strong research infrastructure, including fMRI, PET, EEG and TMS that could be used in the candidate’s research. Further, in the Montreal region there are two research centers that study sensory loss ( Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation , and International Laboratory for Brain, Music and Sound Research ), which could offer additional collaborations. The candidate would have the potential to access clinical populations through the MAB-Mackay Rehabilitation Centre and the Constance-Lethbridge Rehabilitation Centre located close to Concordia University.
Candidates are expected to be exceptional, emerging researchers with the potential to be leaders in their field.  Applicants should propose an innovative research program with the potential to attract external funding and high calibre trainees. 
Located in the heart of vibrant, cosmopolitan Montreal and home to over 46,000 students and 7,000 staff, Concordia University is one of Canada's most innovative urban universities. Over the past decade, Concordia has invested significantly to renew its faculty, expand its infrastructure and create state-of-the-art facilities for research, teaching, and learning. Concordia’s research profile continues to grow as it fosters multidisciplinary approaches to finding solutions to a broad range of societal challenges.
Qualification: Applicants must have a PhD in Psychology or a related discipline (with the degree conferred before August 1, 2018). Applicants should have a demonstrated potential to build a high-quality research program, as well as an interest in contributing to graduate and undergraduate teaching and training. 
Application:  Applications should include:  a cover letter, a curriculum vitae, a description of the planned research program, a statement of teaching philosophy and experience, as well as any evidence of teaching effectiveness. Three letters of reference should also be sent to:

All qualified candidates are encouraged to apply for this position; however, Canadians and Permanent Residents will be given priority. Concordia University is strongly committed to employment equity within its community, and to recruiting a diverse faculty and staff. The University encourages applications from all qualified candidates, including women, members of visible minorities, Indigenous persons, members of sexual minorities, persons with disabilities, and others who may contribute to diversification.
