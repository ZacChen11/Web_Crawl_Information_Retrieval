Tenure-track position on the Theory of Quantum Materials
The Department of Physics at Concordia University seeks a tenure-track faculty member whose research is focused on the Theory of Quantum Materials, and condensed matter theory. The selected candidate is expected to collaborate with faculty members in the Department, and would be encouraged to develop interactions with the members of the Mathematical Physics Group which is based in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. The ideal candidate will have experience with research involving the theory of nanoscale condensed matter systems and novel quantum materials, for instance two-dimensional materials, qubits, and topological materials.  She/he will have an outstanding publication record and experience in areas that could include, but are not limited to condensed matter, mathematical physics, and nanoscience.
Concordia University is a vibrant research and teaching environment, with state-of-the-art research facilities. Concordia is located in Montreal, Canada which is a diverse and creative city, home to several large research Universities, and often ranked as offering one of the best quality of living in North America. The Department of Physics has active research members in both theoretical and experimental condensed matter and quantum materials, and is affiliated with the Concordia-based CeNSR Center for NanoScience Research. The Concordia-based CERMM Centre for Research in Molecular Modeling hosts state-of-the-art computational facilities.
Qualified candidates will have a PhD in Physics or a closely related field, relevant postdoctoral experience, and an outstanding publication record. The selected candidate will be expected to develop a strong independent research program, secure significant external funding and establish collaborations with the members of the Department of Physics. She/He is expected to help position Concordia to be an emerging leader in the theory of quantum materials and their applications in quantum devices. The candidate will be expected to teach at the undergraduate and graduate levels in the Department of Physics.
Application and Appointment Process
Subject to budgetary approval, we anticipate filling this position at the rank of Assistant Professor; however, appointments at the rank of Associate Professor may be considered. The expected start date for this position is August 1, 2018, and all applications should be received by November 15, 2017, for full consideration. Review of applications will continue until the position is filled. Applications must consist of a cover letter, a current curriculum vitae, copies of three (3) representative publications, a statement of teaching philosophy/interests, evidence of teaching effectiveness, and an up to five-page long research proposal. Candidates must also arrange to have three (3) letters of reference submitted directly online by their Referees. Applications and letters of reference must be submitted via the site AcademicJobsOnline.org, at the url:  https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/9531
Inquiries about the position should be directed to Dr. Alexandre Champagne , Chair of the Department of Physics . 
Employment equity
All qualified candidates are encouraged to apply for this position; however, Canadians and Permanent Residents will be given priority. Concordia University is strongly committed to employment equity within its community, and to recruiting a diverse faculty and staff. The University encourages applications from all qualified candidates, including women, members of visible minorities, Indigenous persons, members of sexual minorities, persons with disabilities, and others who may contribute to diversification.
