Tweets by @ProfPatterson
Zachary is Tier-II Canada Research Chair in Transportation and Land Use Linkages for Regional Sustainability. He received his BA (Honours Anthropology) from McGill University in Montreal, his Master's (Economics) from Simon Fraser University in Vancouver and PhD (Geography) from McGill. He was also a postdoctoral researcher at the Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland in the Transport and Mobility Laboratory ( TRANSP-OR ). Professionally he worked as an economist at the NAFTA Commission for Environmental Cooperation and as transportation modeler at the Montreal regional public transportation planner, l'Agence métropolitaine de transport. Zachary's research focuses on the modeling of transportation, the environment, land-use and their linkages. He is currently a member of the Transportation Research Board's Land Development Committee (ADD30), and of the Interuniversity Research Centre on Enterprise Networks, Logistics and Transportation ( CIRRELT ).
Teaching activities
Advanced Quantitative Methods
(Fall 2015)
Over the course of the semester, students will become familiar with the R programming environment at least for the conducting of statistical analysis, and hopefully also for data manipulation and preparation. They will become familiar with the kinds of statistical analysis that is typically used in the fields of geography, planning and environmental studies. They will also work towards understanding the type of statistical analysis that is likely to be done as part of their master’s thesis. Ideally, as part of the term project, the student will be able to work with the same data set they expect to use in the analysis for their thesis. Alternatively, another data set that resembles the data they expect to use for their thesis will be used.
It is open to graduate students. Download most recent course outline  here .
Analyzing Choice
(Winter 2014)
Over the course of this class, students learn to design, implement and analyse the data, from a stated choice survey. The topic of the survey will have to do with an important environmental question. It is open to undergraduate and undergraduate students. Download the most recent undergraduate course outline here .
Transportation GIS
(Winter 2016)
Download the latest course outline .    This course introduces students to the transportation    planning and modeling process aided by the use of a    GIS-based transportation decision aid tool. A real-world    case-study region and transportation system is used     to illustrate the different elements of the planning     and modeling process. The course aims to highlight     both the strengths and weaknesses (particularly with     regards to how it treats the interaction between the     transportation system and land-use) of the traditional     transportation planning approach.

TRIP Lab
TRIP Lab Smartphone Travel Survey Platform Workshop
May 25 and 26, Concordia University
Download the Workshop Agenda
The TRIP Lab is holding a 2-day workshop on Smartphone Travel Surveys and how to use its new Smartphone Travel Survey Platform at Concordia University.
The TRIP Lab platform enables researchers to create their own free smartphone travel survey application.
The Platform is useful for anyone who wants to collect and analyze data on commuting and urban travel behaviour, including:
transportation planning authorities: transit operators, ministries of transportation, etc.
academic researchers: faculty and students from civil engineering, urban planning, geography, health, etc.
not-for-profits and community groups with a transportation focus
Registration is free, but spaces are limited.
Required: Smartphone [Android 4.1 (Jellybean, API 16) or Apple (iOS8.0 and above,  iPhone4S or newer)]
To register, please write to triplab.workshop@gmail.com
Welcome to the lab
The Transportation Research  for Integrated Planning (TRIP) Lab was founded in October 2011 as part of a  Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI) grant associated with a Tier-II Canada  Research Chair in Transportation and Land-use Linkages for Regional Sustainability.  The TRIP lab is equipped with high-powered computers and servers for  geographical and statistical analysis and is able to house up to 10 student  researchers. It is also home to unique and expansive transportation and  land-use data for Montreal as well as other major urban regions across the  country. Analysis of this data is made possible by cutting-edge and  sophisticated software for geographical analysis, transportation modeling and  statistical analysis.
Research  in the TRIP lab focuses on the modeling of transportation, the environment,  land-use and their linkages. It also involves using new technologies to collect  data on where people decide to live and how they move around the city.  Recently, a smartphone  travel survey application                and platform ( Itinerum™ ) has been developed to  conduct origin-destination of members of the Concordia community.
