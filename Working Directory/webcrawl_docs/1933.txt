Program Details
Program requirements
Requirements for the Degree
Credits. A fully qualified candidate entering the program with a master’s/magisteriate degree is required to complete a minimum of 90 credits. These are apportioned as follows: courses and seminars, 18 credits; doctoral examination, 3 credits; thesis proposal, 6 credits; and thesis, 63 credits. Typical progress in the program consists of:
Year 1
Courses: Integrative Seminar: COMS 800 (3 credits), plus three elective courses (9 credits).
Year 2 
Doctoral Examination: COMS 815 (3 credits).
Doctoral Pro-Seminar: COMS 835 (3 credits), and one additional elective course from among the program's offerings (3 credits).
Year 3 
Doctoral Thesis Proposal: COMS 890 (6 credits).
Doctoral Thesis Research: COMS 896 (63 credits).
Courses. All students must enrol in Integrative Seminar (COMS 800) in the first term of Year 1; the Doctoral Pro-Seminar (COMS 835) (3 credits); and enrol in seminars and courses from among the program’s offerings for a total of 21 credits.Students are required to choose a thesis director before the end of their third term in the program.
Supervision. Students are assigned an academic advisor when they first register. Students are required to choose a thesis director before the end of their third term in the program.
Doctoral Examination. Students must successfully pass an examination based on the student’s research areas and interests. The committee for the examination is composed of three professors, including the student’s supervisor. Under normal circumstances, students enrol in the Doctoral Examination in Year 2 of the program. Normally, the written portion of the examination is defended orally by no later than the end of the Fall Term in Year 2. It is compulsory to finish the examination before registering in the Doctoral Pro-Seminar (COMS 835). It is also compulsory to finish the examinationbefore completing the thesis proposal. Students who fail this examination are permitted to take it a second time in the following term. Students failing a second time are obliged to withdraw from the program. Students should consult the program regarding specific examination procedures and requirements.
Doctoral Pro-Seminar. In order to promote the growth of an intellectual community within the program, students are required to register in the theory and research pro-seminar known as the Doctoral Pro-Seminar. Students registered in this seminar engage in research design by workshopping their thesis proposals through iterative presentations with seminar participants, and through multiple written drafts. Students are then required to present a first draft of their thesis proposal. Students typically register in the Doctoral Pro-Seminar in Year 2 of their studies. It is compulsory to finish the Doctoral Examination (COMS 815) before registering in the Doctoral Pro-Seminar.
Thesis Proposal. In the term following the completion of course work (usually the sixth term) students should submit a thesis proposal to their thesis director. Students must have completed the doctoral examination before registering for the thesis proposal. The thesis proposal should be completed within three years of the student’s first enrolment. The proposal must be defended orally before a committee of three professors appointed by the program. Students must demonstrate the viability of their project and their capacity to undertake doctoral thesis research. The proposal may be accepted, returned for modifications, or rejected. The rejection of a proposal results in the student being withdrawn from the program. A student whose proposal is accepted is admitted to candidacy for the PhD.
Thesis Research. All degree requirements, including the thesis, must be completed within six years of the student’s first enrolment for full-time studies and eight years for part-time studies. The thesis must be based on extensive research in primary sources, make an original contribution to knowledge, and be in an acceptable literary form. For purposes of registration, this work is designated as Doctoral Thesis Research (COMS 896).
The doctoral thesis is based on extensive primary research; the goal is to make an original contribution to knowledge. The traditional research thesis is ideally no less than 225 pages and no longer than 350 pages. It must be written in an acceptable literary form and represent a contribution to theoretical or empirical knowledge in the field of communication. Students also have the possibility to produce a research–creation thesis which is to meet the same standards of rigour as the traditional research thesis. The research-creation thesis includes a practical component of creation or innovative production in the field of media/communications or digital/computerized communications, as well as a written component of approximately 150 pages demonstrating the contribution to the advancement of knowledge in the field. A digital reproduction of the practical component must be attached to the manuscript at the time of submission.
