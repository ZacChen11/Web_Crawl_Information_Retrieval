Community Economic Development (GrDip)
Graduate Diploma (GrDip)
Offered by:
School of Community and Public Affairs , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Graduate Diploma in Community Economic Development?
The need to develop effective social policies, programs and communities with the power to confront complex challenges has never been more urgent. As we continue to witness large-scale climate change, as well as political and economic crises worldwide, we require scholars and community sector professionals to reflect on how they can contribute to progressive change and lead projects that inspire civic engagement.
The Graduate Diploma in Community Economic Development provides you with an environment to investigate Quebec and Canada’s social and solidarity economy in a broader context. Our faculty members are actively involved in the community and social economy sector, allowing you to benefit from their scholarship and practical knowledge as you explore the evolution of community economic development, community organizing and different theories of economic change. In today’s context this includes the new and growing interest in social innovation as it generates uncharted paths for community based social and economic transformation.
Our diverse student body is comprised of community sector professionals and students with volunteer experience in a variety of organizations. Many courses in our curriculum are participatory and enriched by the collective experiences of our cohort.  Montreal’s own history of community-based activism and economic development will serve as a backdrop as you participate in a field project with a community organization.

Funding
We are committed to providing you the support you need to focus on your studies. A limited number of scholarships are available for students based on financial need, ranging from $1,000-$5,000.
Please also consult Concordia’s graduate funding page and Financial Aid and Awards .
Field project
You will dedicate between 80 to 120 hours to a field project that addresses an aspect of community development. This field project can be based within your present work, new paid work or in a new or current volunteer context.
The project is an opportunity for you to address a specific challenge you are passionate about and which is also seen as important by the collaborating organization. You are responsible for defining, finding and negotiating your field project, with the support and assistance of our program. You will critically analyze your project and submit a written report that summarizes and evaluates your experience.
Examples of recent past field projects include students collaborating with groups on issues related to immigration, housing, urban agriculture, youth etc. Students are responsible for negotiating the tasks within the field placement with the organization based on organizational needs and student learning interests. Running a conference, providing training, facilitating workshops, supporting inter-organizational collaborations, doing research are examples of tasks that students have taken on as part of their field placement.
Program Structure
The Graduate Diploma in Community Economic Development is structured to enable practitioners to continue work while studying.
Offers all courses during one extended weekend a month (all day Friday, all day Saturday and all day Sunday once a month, as well as a Thursday afternoon every once per term)
Includes a practical project related to a participant’s work or volunteer activity
Alternates annually between English (starting in fall of even years) and French (starting in fall of odd years)
On a full-time basis, takes one year to complete over three consecutive semesters: Fall, Winter and Summer. As the functional language of courses will be different in the following year, a strong motivation usually exists to complete the Program within its framework of three consecutive terms
On a half-time basis, takes two years to complete: two consecutive years if a participant can take courses in both English and French or two non-consecutive years if a participant can take courses in only one language
Your professional future
A Graduate Diploma in Community Economic Development prepares you for careers in various community organizations, including anti-poverty, urban and housing development, women’s rights, and immigration. Many of our alumni have started their own social enterprises, like alternative daycares, laundromats, consumer cooperatives, cafés, as well as the importation and sale of equitable fruits to major distributors. Other career opportunities are available in government and local community economic development agencies, health clinics, education, and unions.
