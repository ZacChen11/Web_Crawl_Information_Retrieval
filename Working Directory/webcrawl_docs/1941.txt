Economics (PhD)
Doctorate (PhD)
Offered by:
Department of Economics , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Doctorate in Economics?
Become a specialist in economics as you conduct high-quality research and produce publishable papers. Connect with distinguished scholars who provide individualized mentorship in multiple fields, including applied econometrics, labour economics, monetary economics, financial economics and game theory.
The PhD in Economics offers broad foundations in the field of economics that enable you to become an expert in one of our department’s many areas of specialization. Work under the guidance of research-active faculty members who have been published in a multitude of prestigious journals , such as Econometrica, the American Economic Review, the Journal of Political Economy, the Review of Economic Studies, the Journal of Econometrics, the Journal of Economic Theory, and the Journal of Monetary Economics.
Take advantage of faculty-led group study meetings that connect researchers and students who are working on similar research topics. The Economics Graduate Students’ Association (EGSA) also runs a seminar series where you can get general advice for conducting research, writing papers and publishing articles, by faculty members who give short talks about their own areas of interest.
Benefit from resources offered by the Centre Interuniversitaire de Recherche en Économie Quantitative (CIREQ) , a cross-institutional research center that connects experts from Concordia University, McGill University and the Université de Montréal. The CIREQ-Concordia seminar series invites internationally renowned scholars to present their latest research findings, and our students are also encouraged to register for advanced elective courses given at all three universities.
Program details
Degree requirements
Requirements for the Degree
Credits. A fully-qualified candidate entering the program with a master’s degree is required to complete a minimum of 90 credits.
Courses. All PhD candidates must take ten one-term graduate courses (30 credits) selected from the Departmental offerings, six of which must be ECON 612: Microeconomics I, ECON 613: Microeconomics II, ECON 615: Macroeconomics I, ECON 616: Macroeconomics II, ECON 680: Econometric Theory I and ECON 681: Econometric Theory II, plus four program electives. A recognition of past graduate work as partial fulfillment of the course requirements for the PhD degree is at the discretion, and subject to the approval of, the Graduate Program Director and the Dean of Graduate Studies. (See the regulation concerning  transfer credits  in this calendar.) Note: If students have taken courses that are required for the PhD program as part of their MA studies, they must substitute them with a maximum of three directed research courses and electives in order to complete the 30 credits required in the PhD program. The directed research courses are chosen in consultation with the thesis supervisor; they are graded pass/fail and are comprised of independent research work carried out under the direction of the thesis supervisor.
Research Seminar. All candidates must take ECON 806: Doctoral Research Seminar (6 credits) requiring the presentation of a paper. This seminar is intended to aid in the development of a doctoral thesis proposal.
Comprehensive Examinations. All candidates must pass three examinations (6 credits) in the areas of: Microeconomic Theory, Macroeconomic Theory and Econometrics. Each of these examinations is set, read and marked by members of the Department. These examinations must be passed before a student enrols in ECON 806.
Fields of Specialization. Each PhD student must have 2 fields of specialization, either as part of the degree of MA or within the students’ PhD program. In order to do this the student must successfully complete 2 courses from the sequences offered in any of the following fields: Economic Development; Financial Economics; Industrial Economics, International Economics; Labour Economics; Public Economics; or 3 courses in one of Econometrics, Macroeconomics or Microeconomics.
Language Requirement. PhD candidates must pass an examination in French. International students may, with the approval of the Department, replace French with another language in which there exists a sufficiently large economics literature.
Thesis. A candidate who has passed the PhD comprehensive examinations must submit in writing to the Graduate Program Director a detailed proposal of a thesis topic. Candidates proceed to work on the thesis (48 credits) only after obtaining approval of the topic from both the Graduate Studies Committee in the Department and the thesis supervisor.
DEPARTMENTAL RULES FOR THE PHD THESIS PROPOSAL
DEPARTMENTAL RULES FOR PHD COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATIONS  
Effective for PhD students who initially registered in September 2017 or later.
Admission requirements
Admission Requirements. A Master of/Magisteriate in Arts in Economics from a recognized university with a cumulative GPA of 3.50 or equivalent. Students with a high standing in a master’s degree or equivalent in other fields, such as commerce, mathematics or business administration from a recognized university may be admitted, subject to satisfactory completion of qualifying requirements, if necessary. Students with a BA (honours) or equivalent with high standing in economics may apply for admission directly to doctoral studies.
Proficiency in English. Applicants whose primary language is not English must demonstrate that their knowledge of English is sufficient to pursue graduate studies in their chosen field. Please refer to the  Graduate Admission page  for further information on the Language Proficiency requirements and exemptions.
GRE. While writing the GRE is not required, such scores certainly enhance an application for admission and especially for funding.

Funding
Teaching assistantships, valued at approximately $3,000 per term in the Fall and Winter, are typically available to each PhD student. Students who have completed their thesis proposal are also eligible to teach a course, which pays a minimum of $8,000. Supervisors may offer advanced doctoral students an extra stipend in the form of a research assistantship.
The Faculty of Arts and Science supports graduate students by offering many fellowships and international tuition remissions. Entrance fellowships are valued at $12,000 for the first three years of study, while Concordia Merit Scholarships offer $10,000 to a number of newly admitted students. Recipients of international tuition remissions are only responsible for paying Quebec rates, which results in approximately $36,000 in savings.
Graduate students may receive a number of departmental scholarships, including the Professor Jaleel Ahmad Scholarship, the Allyson Kassie and Steven Goldberg Graduate Scholarship, and the Balvir and Ranjna Singh Memorial Graduate Award. Scholarship amounts range from $1,500 to $3,500.
Funding opportunities are also available through CIREQ .

Student initiatives
The EGSA aims to promote a stimulating academic and social atmosphere by organizing social events, facilitating seminars and other activities. Seminars organized by the EGSA invite faculty members and graduate students to present their research in economics, and offer you the opportunity to learn more about grant applications and scientific event planning. Doctoral students may also present their own research poster at the Economics Spring Poster Day, an annual showcase of graduate student research in the Department.   
The CIREQ PhD Students’ Conference is an annual event held in Montreal that invites doctoral students to present their research findings. The student-run conference provides a great opportunity to practice your presentation skills, disseminate your research to a friendly audience of peers, and learn about doctoral research in your field conducted in Montreal and elsewhere in Canada.
