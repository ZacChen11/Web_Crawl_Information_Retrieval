History (MA)
Master of Arts (MA)
Offered by:
Department of History , Faculty of Arts & Science
Why pursue a Master's in History?
Our MA program trains inquisitive minds for the 21st century.  The department’s mission is both to prepare historians for careers in teaching and research and produce graduates who share its commitment to serving the broader community. 
As a department of world history with a strong interdisciplinary bent, we offer courses in a broad range of temporal and thematic fields, including law and society, gender and sexuality, public history and memory, genocide and human rights, and transnationalism and empire.  Our acclaimed faculty members are engaged in interdisciplinary research projects and encourage student participation in research projects at the local, national, and international levels.
Benefit from our long-standing affiliation with internationally renowned research institutes dedicated to the study of public history. The Centre for Oral History and Digital Storytelling , the Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies , and the Curating and Public Scholarship Lab provide a wealth of resources for you to develop expertise as oral historian and multimedia storyteller; to communicate research findings in imaginative and unconventional ways; and to gain experience in policy making and public advocacy.
Join a student body that includes young scholars, professionals and working people who are returning to university from successful careers. The size of our MA program is one of its assets: it is large enough to allow for the creation of a collegial cohort of students and a diverse section of seminars each year, but small enough that students have generous access to their supervisors and benefit from the personal mentoring that is one of the hallmarks of our program.

Globalization and Culture

Student initiatives
Graduate students organize one of North America’s longest-running history graduate conferences. History in the Making is an annual bilingual conference that invites students from Quebec, Ontario, Atlantic Canada and the northeastern United States to showcase their work in their respective fields. Past conferences have addressed topics such as “Recording History: Memories, Monuments & Manuscripts,” “Shattered Spaces: Piecing Together Narratives of Crisis and Change” and “Reinterpreting Our Collective Pasts: Community, Identity, and Memory.”
The Graduate History Students’ Association aims to promote a stimulating academic and social atmosphere by organizing social events, informal academic discussions, speaking engagements and other activities.
Your professional future
As a graduate student in history, you will hone your communication and research skills, learn how to combine meticulous attention to detail with a wide-ranging understanding of the historical context, and develop your cultural knowledge and sensitivity.  The ability to comprehend and broker cultural differences is useful in a wide range of fields.
Our alumni find great success in a diverse range of professional careers, including international relations, pharmaceuticals, health care, media, government, social work, journalism, law, politics, public advocacy, archives management, documentary filmmaking and education.
Our MA history graduates have been accepted to highly competitive doctoral programs, such as Columbia University, Yale University, Rutgers University, the University of Toronto and the University of Michigan.
