How can I make the changes I most want to see in the world?
Eva Pomeroy on the Concordia U.lab Social Innovation Hub

Concordia’s Social Innovation Hub is designed to create a multi-sector, intergenerational learning community focused on social innovation. If you happen to walk into the Hub this fall on a Thursday morning, you’ll see students enrolled in AHSC 498 Leadership, Change and Social Innovation, along with faculty, staff and various members of community organizations working together. And that’s the point. Concordia’s U.lab creates an opportunity to engage in dialogue across boundaries that sometimes separate the community from the university, younger adults from older, and students from faculty. This ability for the Hub to cross boundaries is a core component of the learning experience.
Together, we explore questions such as:
 - How can I make the changes I most want to see in the world?
 - What are the root sources of creativity and innovation and how can I tap into them?
 - How can collaborative learning, organizing and leadership be harnessed to meet the social challenges of our times?
An educational innovation itself, the Concordia U.lab Social Innovation Hub is a learning experience that is ‘hosted’ rather than taught. All participants, including the host team, participate as co-learners in a 10-week process of social innovation learning. The platform that enables the community to form in this way is U.lab – a MOOC developed by Otto Scharmer at MIT’s Sloan School of Management and which integrates social science, mindfulness and design thinking in the service of civil society.
All hub participants register for the MOOC and complete the online course in their own time. Then, each week, Hub members gather to work with the material in-person. This “on-line to off-line” learning model helps leverage the best of technology, such as accessibility and a sense of global connection, with the human need to create connections in a community.
The process itself takes participants through three broad “movements”. First, they learn techniques for deep observation and understanding of both their immediate environments and the wider global context. Second, they engage in a period of mindfulness and reflection that allows them to fully integrate their observations and provide space for innovation and creativity to emerge. Finally, participants move into a period of action and prototyping.
The opportunity to engage in a powerful learning process within a diverse community servicing society makes the Concordia U.lab Social Innovation Hub an experience not to be missed!
The fall session of Concordia's U.Lab begins September 14. To learn more or register for U.Lab, visit the webpage here or contact us via u.lab@concordia.ca .
Eva Pomeroy is Social Innovator in Residence at Concordia's Faculty of Arts and Science.
