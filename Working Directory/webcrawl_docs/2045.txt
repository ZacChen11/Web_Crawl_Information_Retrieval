My research moves between poetics, philosophy, and science/technology studies, investigating conceptual and material determinations of structure and form. Recently my published work has also focused on contemporary art, film, and communist theory.
 
My first book, The Limits of Fabrication: Materials Science, Materialist Poetics (Fordham UP) studies concepts of form and practices of fabrication in nanoscale materials science and materialist poetics. I offer a renewed consideration of poiesis as "making" and a materialist account of poetry as a form of building, examining the manner in which such poets as Charles Olson, Ronald Johnson, Caroline Bergvall, Christian Bök, and Shanxing Wang have developed formal models in conversation with quantum mechanics, cybernetics, geodesic architecture, biotechnology, crystallography, and nanotechnology, while also tracking the pertinence of these fields to structural models at issue in materials science and engineering. My questions are: how do shared concepts of form and approaches to fabrication bear upon material making in poetry and science? What are the philosophical and ideological stakes of understanding their discrepancies and their confluence?
I am currently completing a book manuscript titled "Rationalist Empiricism: A Theory of Speculative Method." Moving from Plato to Descartes and Hume through Hegel, Marx, Althusser, and Meillassoux, the project reexamines the methodological relationship between rationalism and empiricism in order to assess its consequences for discrepant conflicts between idealism and materialism in ancient, modern, and contemporary philosophy. 
With Petar Milat, I am the coordinator of an ongoing series of annual symposia in Zagreb and Dubrovnik, titled  Conjuncture--21st Century Philosophy, Politics, and Aesthetics . These events have resulted in two edited volumes, The Art of the Concept (2013) and Poiesis (2017). 
My recent teaching has focused primarily on 20th and 21st century poetry, Marxist approaches to literary periodization, and major texts in modern European philosophy.
From 2008-2014, I was Assistant Professor in the Department of English and Program in Critical Theory at the University of California, Davis.
