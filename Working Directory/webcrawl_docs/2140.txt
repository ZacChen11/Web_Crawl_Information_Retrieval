Teaching about Extremism, Terror, and Trauma
Dr.   Arshad-Ayaz is a post-colonial critical theorist. She has taught for   universities in Pakistan (Humdard University), Canada (McGill   University, Bishops University, University of Regina and Concordia   University) and the United Kingdom (external program University of   London, London School of Economics (LSE).
Dr.   Arshad-Ayaz’s research and teaching practice draws from a number of   theoretical traditions, including critical theory, critical pedagogy,   feminist theory, post-colonial, and other global discourses.  
Her   previous anthropological background and work experience directs her   analyses to focus on the social, cultural, historical, political and   economic dynamics of a particular context that affect teaching and   learning. In the area of comparative and international education her   research demonstrates the importance of context in providing an   understanding of not what works in education but what works under what context.
Dr.   Arshad-Ayaz’s published work explores education policies and programs   especially those related to the introduction of educational technology   in Pakistan and other developing countries.  Dr.   Arshad-Ayaz has also published on the impact of globalization on   education policies and practices in North American and European   context.
