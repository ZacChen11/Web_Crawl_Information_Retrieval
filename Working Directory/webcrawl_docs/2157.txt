Research interests
WilliamM. Bukowskiis a Professor in the Department of Psychology.   He holds a University Research Chair in earlyadolescent development.   From 2008 to 2016 he was the director of the Centrede recherche en développement humain,.  He is the 2014 recipient of the John P HillMemorial Award from the Society forResearch in Adolescence and is a Charter Fellow of the InternationalSociety for the Study of Behavioral Development.
The goal of his research program is to understand how and why children's and adolescents' experiences with their peers affect competence and well-being. His projects are aimed at identifying and measuring the fundamental characteristics of children's interactions and relationships with their peers and determining how these experiences affect behavioral development, emotional adjustment and physical health.   His laboratory has a particular interest in the processes that account for the protective effects of friendship on anxiety.  The current themes of his research projects are (a) contextual/cultural differences in peer experiences and the processes that account for variations in the effects of peer relations; (b)  the intersection between peer experiences and psychophysiology especially the response to stress; (c) the origins, structure, and functioning of the self concept; and (d) gender differences especially as they are related to culture.  His laboratory is also specialized in several forms of measurement including sociomtric measures, peer assessment, and self-report measures of multiple components of anxiety, friendship experiences, and aspects of the self concept.
