Biography
Thanh Dang-Vu earned his M.D. in 2004 at the Université de Liège, in Belgium. He then completed his residency in Neurology and a Ph.D. in Biomedical Science in the same university. He did a post-doctoral fellowship in the department of Neurology at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. He completed a second postdoctoral fellowship at the Center for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine at the Université de Montreal and Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal. He won several research awards, notably from the Sleep Research Society, the European Sleep Research Society, the Belgian Association for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine, and the Belgian Neurological Society. He joined Concordia University in 2012, where he is currently an Associate Professor and holds the University Research Chair in Sleep, Neuroimaging and Cognitive Health. He is  a CIHR New Investigator and a FRQS Research Scholar. Dr Dang-Vu is also an attending neurologist and the Associate Director for Clinical Research at the Institut Universitaire de Gériatrie de Montréal (IUGM), a Clinical Assistant Professor of Neuroscience at University of Montreal, and an Adjunct Professor of Neurology and Neurosurgery at McGill University.
Research
Sleep, brain oscillations, EEG, neuroimaging, cognition, insomnia, aging
Overview: In general, my research interests are focused on the interface between neuroimaging, sleep, and neurology, in order to investigate the neural correlates of spontaneous brain activity and consciousness, the role of sleep in brain plasticity, the pathophysiology of sleep disorders, and the clinical biomarkers of neurological disease progression.
I am particularly interested in the mechanisms and functions of brain rhythms during sleep. These neural oscillations (sleep spindles, slow waves) organize brain activity during sleep and modulate important functional properties of sleep. For instance, using simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG), my previous studies demonstrated the role of these brain rhythms in the neural processing of external information (e.g., sounds) during sleep. Current research in my lab further explores the role of sleep oscillations in cognition and brain plasticity, in healthy participants and patients with neurological disorders (e.g., stroke, neurodegenerative diseases), using functional and structural neuroimaging techniques, and electrophysiological recordings.
Another line of research in my laboratory investigates the pathophysiology of sleep disorders, such as insomnia, hypersomnias and parasomnias, using multimodal neuroimaging and EEG. Beyond the identification of the neural mechanisms responsible for sleep disruption and daytime somnolence, these studies aim at further understanding the clinical evolution and cognitive impact of these disorders, in order to inform treatment options.
Funding
My research is funded by the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI), the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Fonds de la recherche du Québec – Santé (FRQ-S), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the Sleep Research Society Foundation, Institut Universitaire de Gériatrie de Montréal, and Concordia University
