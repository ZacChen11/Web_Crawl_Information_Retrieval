Research interests
Evolutionary Genomics, Molecular Systematics, Population Genetics, Phylogeography, Biodiversity Conservation
My research program is aimed at gaining insights into the processes underlying the origin and maintenance of biological diversity with specific focus on the ecology, evolution and genomics of forest trees, and understanding the causes and consequences of deforestation and forest fragmentation. Understanding these processes provides the necessary basis for the development of sound conservation and management strategies for forested areas. Current research projects in my laboratory include molecular phylogenetic studies and characterization of molecular markers for genomic mapping and gene flow studies in a variety of organisms including tropical and temperate forest tree.
