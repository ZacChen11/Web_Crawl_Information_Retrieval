Karl Hele's Explore Concordia page
Dr. K. S. Hele is a member of the Garden River First  Nation community of the Anishinaabeg people and was educated at schools in  Sault Ste. Marie. He earned a B.A. (Waterloo) in 1993, a M.A. (Toronto) in  1994, and a Ph.D. (McGill) in 2003. His dissertation examined the Ojibwa  encounter with nineteenth-century missionaries to Sault Ste. Marie. He has  served as the joint editor of the Algonquian Proceedings (vols. 39 to  41) and has presented and published papers on the history of the Anishinabeg  and Métis communities in the Sault Ste. Marie region. More recent publications  have examined how the international border has affected First Nations  communities in the Great Lakes region. Additionally, Dr. Hele is a contributor  of columns and book reviews to the Anishinabek  News and a columnist to the Sault  Star (Sault Ste. Marie). He continues to work on topics related to the  international border and the Hiawatha Pageant as well as other items of  interest not only to himself but the Bawating Anishinaabe and Metis  communities.

Biographie
M. Karl S. Hele fait partie de la communauté anishinaabe  de la Première Nation de Garden River. Après avoir terminé ses études  préuniversitaires à Sault‑Sainte‑Marie, il a obtenu un baccalauréat ès arts à l’Université de Waterloo (en 1993), une maîtrise ès arts à l’Université de  Toronto (en 1994) et un doctorat à l’Université McGill (en 2003). Sa thèse portait sur la  rencontre entre les Ojibwés et les missionnaires à Sault‑Sainte‑Marie au XIXe siècle.  Corédacteur des Algonquian Conference Proceedings (vol. 39 à 41), il  a publié des articles et présenté des communications sur l’histoire des communautés  anishinaabe et métisse de la région de Sault‑Sainte‑Marie. Ses publications  récentes traitent des effets qu’a eus le tracé de la frontière internationale  sur les Premières Nations de la région des Grands Lacs. M. Hele rédige  pour le mensuel Anishinabek News des  chroniques et des comptes rendus de livres. Il est également chroniqueur au quotidien The Sault Star de Sault‑Sainte‑Marie.
