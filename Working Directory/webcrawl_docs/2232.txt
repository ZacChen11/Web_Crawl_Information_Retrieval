Explore Concordia page
Overview
Prof. Louis Patrick Leroux is a playwright, director, and scholar who holds a joint appointment in both departments of English and French Studies.
After degrees in Theatre (Ottawa, BA; Sorbonne nouvelle, DEA), French Literature (Ottawa, BA), and Arts Management (HEC-Montréal, DESS), he earned his doctorate in Theatre and the Performing Arts from the Sorbonne nouvelle. Before joining academia, he worked as a playwright and director and was the founding Artistic Director of Ottawa’s Théâtre la Catapulte during the 1990s and a co-founder of la Nouvelle scène theatre space in Ottawa.
His academic research and graduate supervision covers modern and contemporary theatre, self-representation in drama, cultural discourse, research-creation, dramaturgy, Québec literature, literatures on the margins, and contemporary circus.
Scholarly Work
Recent scholarly collections include Cirque Global: Québec’s Expanding Circus Boundaries, co-edited with Charles Batson (McGill-Queen’s University Press, 2016), “North-South Circus Circulations” edited issue of Québec Studies (2014), and Le jeu des positions. Discours du théâtre québécois, co-edited with Hervé Guay (Nota Bene, 2014).
He also edited issues for L’Annuaire théâtral: “Le Québec à Las Vegas” (2009) and “Ordre et désordonnancement”(2008). Currently, he is co-editing another issue, with Catherine Cyr, on textualities and the body in performance (2018).
Current projects include a book-length study of Cirque du Soleil in Las Vegas. He is a co-author of an historical synthesis of Québec theatre (under the stewardship of Gilbert David). Along with Katie Lavers and Jon Burtt, he is also working ona new book on contemporary circus creators for Routledge.
He has published articles in French, English, and Spanish translation in L’Annuaire théâtral, Theatre Research in Canada, Journal of Canadian Studies, Québec Studies, Voix et images, alt.theatre, Études théâtrales, L’Aparté, Apuntes de teatro, Revue dethéâtre Jeu, Spirale, Canadian Theatre Review, L’oiseau-tigre,EntrActe, and Canadian Literature. Articles have been anthologized in The Routledge Circus Studies Reader(2016) and Le théâtre québécois en revue (Presses de l’Université du Québec, 2014).
Creative Work
Recent creative publications include False Starts (Talonbooks, 2016), Ludwig & Mae (in French, Prise de parole, 2016, in English, Talonbooks, 2009), Dialogues fantasques pour causeurs éperdus (Prise de parole, 2012), and Setaire (Prise de parole, 2010). He is the author of over thirty plays, films, and radio plays, with recent productions and staged readings in Montreal (2009, 2012), Ottawa (2010 and 2015), Vancouver (2013), and Santiago, Chile (2013).
His recent work on university-based research-creation can be seen on http://resonance.hexagram.ca , this includes theatrical productions, film, dance, and video installation. He has done additional research-creation work on circus, in a laboratory setting involving multi-media and dramaturgy (National Circus School, les 7 doigts de la main, Géodézik) and is currently embarked on a four-year funded study of the dramaturgy of movement in contemporary circus and physical theatre (FRQ-SC, 2015-18).
In the summer of 2016, his Hamlet on the Wire—Hamlet sur le fil, a theatrical performance for high wire and sound installation, was presented in Montreal. This resonant response to Shakespeare’s work was the second, after Milford Haven (video installation, 2012), of a series of more such adaptations to come.
