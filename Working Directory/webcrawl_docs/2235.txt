Dr. Linds has been a full-time faculty member at Concordia  since August, 2004.Before beginning his graduate studies at the University of  British Columbia in 1996, he spent 17 years working in international  development education. Dr. Linds also worked for 6 years in community  television, radio and newspapers in Vancouver and Newfoundland. He has had  extensive experience in popular theatre and community development. This  background has been critical to his teaching approach where he brings practical  experiences and theoretical approaches together.
