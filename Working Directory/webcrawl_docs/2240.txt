Damon Matthews's Explore Concordia page
Dr. Damon Matthews is Professor and Tier 1 Concordia University Research Chair (Climate Science and Sustainability) in     the Department of Geography Planning and Environment. He obtained a B.Sc. in Environmental    Science from Simon Fraser University in 1999, and a Ph.D. in Earth and Ocean Sciences from     the University of Victoria in 2004. Prior to joining Concordia University in January 2007,     Dr. Matthews held a post-doctoral fellowship at the University of Calgary, and worked as a post-doctoral     researcher at the Carnegie Institution at Stanford. His research is aimed at better understanding the many possible interactions between human     activities, natural ecosystems and future climate change, and contributing to the scientific     knowledge base required to promote the development of sound national and international     climate policy. Dr. Matthews has published more than 90 research papers on topics such as the climate response to cumulative carbon emissions, estimating allowable emissions for climate targets, and exploring equitable ways of sharing the global emissions quota.  Dr. Matthews is a member of the College of New Scholars, Artists and Scientists of the Royal Society of Canada, serves as Concordia's scientific liaison to Future Earth, and was a contributing author to the Fourth and Fifth Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental     Panel on Climate Change.

Graduate student opportunities
I am looking for graduate students interested in learning about global warming and climate              modelling, and exploring the role of greenhouse gas cycles in the context of recent and              future climate change.  Potential students should have good quantitative skills, and some              knowledge of computer programming would be an asset.  Possible research projects include:
Estimating the climate response to cumulative greenhouse gas emissions
Predicting allowable emissions for global climate change policy targets
Projecting future changes in the availability of outdoor skating
Assessing national contributions to and responsibility for global warming
Modelling the atmospheric sinks for methane and nitrous oxide
Modelling the influence of past and future land-use change on climate
Assessing climate impacts as a function of global mean temperature change
