Explore Concordia page
Dr Monica Mulrennan is Associate Professor in the Department of Geography,Planning and Environment.
She was born and raised in Ireland where she completed her BA and PhD degrees at University College Dublin before moving to Australia for post-doctoral work at the University of Wollongong and the Australian National University. From there she moved to Canada where she held an NSERC International Post-doctoral Fellowship at McGill University. She joined the Department of Geography,Planning and Environment at Concordia University in 1994, and has since served as Graduate Program Director, Undergraduate Programs Advisor, and Associate Dean, Graduate Student Affairs, in the School of Graduate Studies. She is currently Chair of the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment.
A physical geographer by training, Dr Mulrennan's research interests focus on indigenous peoples and their knowledge, use, and stewardship of coastal/marine environments. More specifically, her research is focused on community-driven strategies of environmental protection that draw upon indigenous institutions of knowledge and practice and enhance local authority over decisions affecting their lives, lands, seas and resources. This work addresses local ecological knowledge, land and sea tenure systems, community-based conservation, protected area development, human adaptations to environmental change, as well as the documentation of placenames, stories and personal narratives.
Dr Mulrennan has worked closely with Torres Strait Islanders (northern Queensland) since the early 1990s, initially as coordinator of their Marine Strategy for Torres Strait and more recently, in collaboration with Colin Scott(Anthropology, McGill University) in the documentation of lslander knowledge,marine resource use and Islander sea claims on Erub (Darnley), an island in the eastern Torres Strait at the northernmost tip of the Great Barrier Reef. She has worked with James Bay Crees (northern Quebec), particularly the Cree Nation of Wemindji, for more than twenty years and is centrally involved in research supporting the creation of community-led protected areas in Wemindji; this includes the Paakumshumwaau-Maatuskaau Biodiversity Reserve on an area of 4,500 km sq (which represents about 20 percent of Wemindji’s traditional lands) and a proposal to establish a 20,000 km sq Tawich (marine) Conservation Area in the adjacent offshore. Dr Mulrennan’s sustained research engagements with both James Bay Crees and Torres Strait Islanders are defined by the three core principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR): 1) a community-defined research agenda; 2) a collaborative research process; and 3) meaningful research outcomes.
Dr Mulrennan directs the Indigenous Resource Management Research Group (IRM lab) at Concordia which currently includes five PhD students and four MSc students. She, along with several of her graduate students, is an active member of the FQRSC-funded McGill-based Centre for Indigenous Conservation and Development Alternatives (CICADA) and the McGill-based project on Indigenous Stewardship of the Environment and Alternative Development(INSTEAD). She is also a co-investigator of the Indigenous theme of a SSHRC Partnership Grant Rural Policy Learning Commons (RPLC) and serves as Coordinator of Axis 4 (Human Dimensions of Biodiversity Science) of the FRQNT-funded Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Science (QCBS).

Research activities
Indigenous Resource Management Research Lab (IRMLAB)
Dr Mulrennan oversees a dynamic lab focussed on themes and topics related to Indigenous Resource Management. Students with research interests in this field, or in community-based conservation more broadly, are invited to apply to work with her through the MSc. Program in Geography, Urban and Environmental Studies.
