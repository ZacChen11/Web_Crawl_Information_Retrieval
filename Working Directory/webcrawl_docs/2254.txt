Research
The overarching mission of my lab is to contribute to the training and career development of new scientists --undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral research students pursuing careers in behavioural neuroscience research. Students who train here can master a wide variety of behavioural techniques and use them to explore the organization of behaviour systems, and the neural bases of learning and memory.
Our specific lines of research have covered a diverse range of topics in recent years, including:
- the roles of perirhinal cortex and hippocampus in mediating and modulating effects of estrogens on cognitive ability (Gervais et al., 2013; Gervais et al., 2014;Gervais et al., 2015; Gervais et al., 2016)
-memory reconsolidation, especially in the realms of fear-learning and object-recognition (in progress)
- entorhinal cortex damage and retrograde memory for spatial and non-spatial information (Gaskin et al., 2009; Gervais et al., 2014).
-demonstrating limitations of the existing methodologies for assessing object-recognition memory in rats (i.e., novelty-preference tests), and developing new and improved methods (Gaskin et al., 2010;  other work still in progress)
- functional interactions involving hippocampal damage, contextual information processing,and object-recognition memory (Piterkin et al., 2008; other work still in progress)
In addition to dedicated lines of inquiry pursued by students in the Mumby lab, we usually have one or more ongoing collaborations with researchers at other universities. This broadens the range of research topics and questions students can explore, and the range of analytical techniques they may encounter and learn. Our most recent collaborations (over the past two or three years) have included the following topics:
-hippocampal damage and circadian time-place learning (Cole et al., 2016)
-neuro-developmental correlates of spatial learning (Wartman et al., 2012; Comba et al., 2015)
-modulatory effects of environmental enrichment on behavioural and somatic responses to extrinsic stressors (Huzard et al., 2015)
-oxytocin effects on novelty-preference in female rats (Madularu  et al., 2014a) and in male prairie voles(Madularu et al., 2014b).
All behavioural data for these projects were collected in the Mumby lab (except for Madularu et al. 2014b). The diversity of our research topics sets us apart somewhat from the more typical, ultra-specialized behavioural-neuroscience labs. Doctoral students in my lab pursue research lines that are their own, not just a continuation of some previous research from my lab. With this approach I aim to help these early-career scientists establish themselves as independent researchers. While conducting research for their thesis or dissertation, students in my lab also contribute to other research projects, thus broadening their knowledge, experience, and publication records.
One reason we can conduct original research on such a range of topics, and publish in high-quality journals, is because we have tremendous lab facilities and other resources at our disposal. Our lab has ample space to accommodate the extensive array of apparatuses and other equipment we use in our experiments, and this enables us to have several experiments going on at the same time. As part of the Center for Studies in Behavioural Neurobiology, students in our lab have access to a broad selection of neurobiology research techniques and tools, as well as the expertise and potential training opportunities provided through our collaborations with other CSBN labs.

Biography
Dave Mumby received his Ph.D. in Biopsychology from the University of British Columbia in 1992. In 1994, after 18 months in a postdoctoral research position in Dr. Robert Sutherland's laboratory at the University of New Mexico, Dr. Mumby joined the Department of Psychology at Concordia University. In 1999 he joined the Center for Studies in Behavioural Neurobiology.
Dr. Mumby is a Fellow of Concordia University's Science College.
