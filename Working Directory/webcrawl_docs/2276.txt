On leave for the 2017-18 academic year as a Member of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ
Jonathan Sachs specializes in British literature of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, with a particular focus on the uses of antiquity in forging literary and political modernity in Britain during this time. He has a PhD in English Literature from the University of Chicago and BA and MA degrees from the University of Cambridge.
Sachs is the author of Romantic Antiquity: Rome in the British Imagination, 1789-1832 ( Oxford University Press , 2010). With the aid of a year-long fellowship from the National Humanities Center (US) and a Standard Research Grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, he is currently finishing a new book-length study of cultural decline which seeks to explain anxieties about decline in connection with three other major features of the late 18th century: the development of political economy, the rapid expansion of print media, and the emergent fascination with ruins. The book uses each of these categories to raise questions about how changing conceptions of progress and decline can help to index new Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment ways of understanding time and historical experience. Other research interests include eighteenth-century travel to antique lands, emergent understandings of orality, and the importance of place in literary interpretation.
Sachs also maintains an active interest in print culture and media history. He is the Principal Investigator of the Interacting with Print Research Group: http://interactingwithprint.org/
In 2011 Sachs held Visiting Fellowships at Clare Hall, Cambridge and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. In March 2010, Sachs was the Benjamin Meaker Visiting Professor at the University of Bristol. 
Recently, Professor Sachs has been invited to present aspects of his current research at a number of venues including the CUNY Graduate Center, the University of California at Berkeley, the Centre for Eighteenth Century Studies at the University of York (UK), Stanford University, Harvard University, the University of Bristol, and the University of Glasgow.  In addition to the SSHRC and the National Humanities Center, Professor Sachs’s research has received support from the Paul Mellon Centre for British Art in London, the Huntington Library, the Folger Shakespeare Library, the Fonds québécois de la recherché sur la société et la culture, the Keats-Shelley Association of America, and the Special Collections of the University of Chicago Library.
