Education

M.Sc. Sciences de l’activité physique (spec. in Sociology of Health and Physical Activity), Université Laval
B.A. Sociologie, Université Laval
Mini-Biography
Geneviève Rail received her Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where Cultural Studies specialist Norman Denzin supervised her. She has taught courses related to women’s bodies, physical activity and health at the University of Ottawa’s Faculty of Health Sciences from 1991 to 2009. She is now Professor of Feminist Cultural Studies of Health at the Simone de Beauvoir Institute of Concordia University. She is known for her research on women’s experiences of body-related institutions (e.g., health industries and systems, media, sport) and favors feminist poststructuralist, post/de/colonial and queer approaches. Author of over 100 articles or book chapters, she has been a keynote speaker in over 50 national or international conferences. In the last 20 years, she has received funding from Canadian and Australian research councils (ARC, SSHRC, CIHR) for a series of research projects involving women from varying sexuality, race, ethnicity, ability, and socioeconomic milieus. She is interested in the intersection and articulation of these women’s identifications with the discursive constructions and embodied experiences of the body and health. Her current CIHR-funded projects focus on fatness, on HPV vaccination, and on breast and gynaecological cancer care for LBTQ persons.

Teaching activities
WSDB 398 AA Special Topics: Summer Institute
The Simone de Beauvoir Summer Institute is a week-long feminist course approached from a multi-disciplinary perspective (humanities, social sciences, visual and performing arts). Undergraduate and graduate students, as well as community members are welcome to attend, either for credit or as a conference. The Summer Institute consists of workshops, panels and discussions led by a diversity of instructors and speakers from within and outside Concordia. 
For 2018, the Summer Institute’s theme is UNSETTLING FEMINISMS. Over the past four decades, feminists have addressed theories, and practices on, race, sexuality, gender, embodiment, nationalisms, and imperialisms. As a result, significant paradigmatic shifts away from patriarchal, colonial, white, ahistorical, universal and/or “single issue” feminist thinking have been put forth. Despite these important strides, conceptual, disciplinary, theoretical and practical barriers persist, thus the need to unsettle dominant feminisms. The 2018 Summer Institute will bring together scholars, activists, artists, and students from a broad range of disciplines and fields to take part in the unsettling, undoing, protesting, and revising of feminisms. The Summer Institute will encourage conversations about Indigenous knowledge and research methods, the violence of white settler societies, anti-colonialism and anti-racism, activism, art, and the consideration of new knowledges from a broad spectrum of disciplines and practices.
WSDB 391 Health Issues: Feminist Perspectives
This course presents feminist, intersectional, postcolonialist, poststructuralist and queer examinations of a variety of women’s health issues. It explores the complex cultural politics that tend to legitimize existing power relations in health care, health research, and ‘health’ industries. Topics include biopolitics and surveillance of women’s bodies, medicalization and disease mongering, patriarchal capitalism and the health industry, cosmetic surgery and oppression or agency, women’s health and sociocultural identifications, feminist medical ethics, and alternative and feminist healthcare.
WSDB 491 Advanced Seminar: Feminist Perspectives on Culture
This seminar explores the central concepts and theories in feminist cultural studies, as they inform feminist, post-colonial, queer, and post-structuralist understandings of culture. The focus is on women as cultural producers and subjects in/of various cultural texts (e.g. cinema, visual arts, music, advertising, popular media, feminist writings). The discursive construction of gender, as it is inflected by class, race, sexuality and location, is examined as well as the ways in which it is used, displayed, imagined and performed in contemporary culture. Students develop practical and analytical skills, posing feminist questions of how particular cultural narratives function within social, political and economic contexts. Students are required to participate in and lead discussions of the readings and to create and/or critique cultural productions.
