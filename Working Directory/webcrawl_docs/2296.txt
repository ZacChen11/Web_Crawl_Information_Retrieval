Media
Our demonstration of a potent anti-tumor effect  of lithocholic acid in cultured human cancer cells and our identification of  the mechanisms underlying such effect of lithocholic acid has been highlighted  in the news media, including: The Montreal Gazette; Radio-Canada; The Vancouver  Sun; La Presse; Métro Montréal; The Regina Leader-Post; The Windsor Star; The  Edmonton Journal; Calgari Herald; MSN Technologie; Bio-Medicine; Medical  Xpress; Biology News Net; News Medical; Food Consumer; Science Daily;  ScienceNewsline; Canada.com; Cancer; Anti-Aging News; Herbal Treatment; Le  Devoir; FierceBiotech; Drug Discovery & Development; BrightSurf.com;  Psychomedia; mediLexicon; Walfadjri; Medical News Today; Sante log; La Tribune;  Bioscience Technology; Concordia NOW; The Concordian and others.
Dr. Vladimir Titorenko has been named “Personnalité de la  semaine La Presse/Radio-Canada” (see here and here ).
