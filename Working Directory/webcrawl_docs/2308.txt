Darren Wershler's Explore Concordia page
My work focuses on the relationship between avant-garde  art and writing on one hand and communication studies and media history on the  other. Inside the academy, I've been a professor in both English and  Communication Studies departments. I've also worked professionally as a writer,  editor, designer and publisher of print and new media. As a result, I take an  interdisciplinary approach to research and teaching, and am committed to the  notion that universities need to search continually for ways to build connections  to people, organizations and things outside of themselves.
My most recent book, Guy Maddin's My Winnipeg (fall  2010), concerns a major work by Canada's  most iconoclastic filmmaker. Through his reinvention of half-forgotten film  genres, his remobilization of abandoned techniques from the early history of  cinema, and his unique editing style, Maddin has created a critically  successful oeuvre that looks like nothing else in Canadian film. My Winnipeg (2008), which  Roger Ebert called one of the ten best films of the first decade of the  twenty-first century, has consolidated Maddin's international reputation. I  argue that Maddin's use of techniques and media falls outside of the normal  repertoire of contemporary cinema, which requires us to re-examine what we  think we know about the documentary genre and even 'film' itself. Through an  exploration of the film's major thematic concerns - memory, the cultural  archive, and how people and objects circulate through the space of the city - I  contend that My Winnipeg is intriguing because it is psychologically and  affectively true without being historically accurate.
My collaborative work over the last six years will  culminate in another volume, titled Dynamic Fair Dealing, co-edited with  Rosemary Coombe and Martin Zeilinger. In this volume, a group of scholars,  activists, and artists from a variety of disciplines and genres will explore  the relations between intellectual property laws, technology and code,  institutional practices and other obstacles to mobility that mediate the  cultural worlds Canadians can imagine and explore as educators, researchers and  creators. The essays will place particular emphasis on practices of dynamic  fair dealing - emergent approaches to the creation, circulation and management  of digital cultural objects that challenge and/or present alternatives to  traditional paradigms of intellectual property.
Work in the planning stages includes a monograph on  conceptual writer and artist Kenneth Goldsmith, which will approach his work  from the perspective of media poetics; and an anthology of essays on conceptual  poetics, co-edited with Vanessa    Place.
