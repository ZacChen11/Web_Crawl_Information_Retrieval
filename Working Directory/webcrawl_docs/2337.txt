BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
Development and validation of novel LC-MS assay for peptide hormone analysis in human plasma
About the research
Dr. Dajana Vuckovic  is offering one  scholarship opportunity for a student applying for Concordia University’s PhD in Chemistry or Biochemistry program. The student’s research will focus on the development of a novel mass spectrometry (MS) – based approach for highly sensitive detection of selected hormone peptides. The student will join the vibrant Vuckovic group whose research intersects metabolomics, lipidomics, and biomarker validation, with the focus on improving the coverage of low abundance metabolome.  The primary objectives of the research project are to develop effective sample preparation and derivatization strategies for hormone peptides, to validate the optimized assay in human plasma using liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and to systematically compare the performance of the final assay to immunoassays. Hormone peptides play an important role in the regulation of many physiological processes such as appetite, stress, growth, vasoconstriction and pain signalling. The developed assay(s) will help to facilitate more detailed future studies on the role and regulation of selected peptides, including the effect of lifestyle. The student will gain hands-on expertise in bioanalytical chemistry, sample preparation, chromatography, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and method validation according to regulatory guidelines. The successful candidate will have various opportunities to present at national and international conferences and author manuscript(s) based on their research.  Vuckovic group offers on-site state-of-the-art high resolution mass spectrometry facility and access/affiliation to mass spectrometry and other bioanalytical instrumentation in three leading Concordia research centres: Centre for Biological Applications of Mass Spectrometry, Centre for Structural and Functional Genomics and PERFORM Centre. 
The selected candidate will receive a generous funding package consisting of a Research Assistantship Bursary, Teaching Assistantship, as well as the special Evaluation of new extraction materials for metabolomics and lipidomics Fellowship valued at $10,000 in Year I of their program.  The total financial package will exceed $26,000 in Year I and $24,000 in Year II of the program. Applicants will also be considered for additional scholarships, including third and fourth year funding for Doctoral students, and tuition remissions for International and Canadian students.
