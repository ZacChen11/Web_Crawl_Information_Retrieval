MSc/PhD
in Green Inorganic Chemistry
Bio-Inspired Oxidation Catalysis
About the research
Dr. Xavier Ottenwaelder is offering one scholarship opportunity for a student applying for either an MSc or PhD in Concordia University’s Chemistry program. The student will focus her/his efforts on developing novel catalytic methods to carry out oxidations of organic compounds.
Research in the XoRG strives to harvest the oxidative power of simple oxidants such as molecular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide in order to develop organic oxidation processes that are both selective and environmentally benign. The MSc/PhD student will (1) synthesize and characterize a series of tailored-designed, redox noninnocent metal complexes and (2) perform oxidation reaction screening and optimizing under a variety of stoichiometric and catalytic conditions. At the PhD level, the student shall also study the reaction mechanism via spectroscopy and/or computation. This work is at the confluence of coordination, bio-inorganic, organic and green chemistry. Student thus received extensive training in marketable skills and techniques.
The selected candidate will receive a generous funding package that should exceed $24,000 in Year I and $24,000 in the following one (MSc) or two (PhD) years of the program. The offer includes a Research Assistantship Bursary, a Teaching Assistantship, and Faculty of Arts and Science Entrance Awards such as the Concordia University Graduate Fellowship (PhD) of $32,400 and Merit Scholarship (MSc or PhD) of $10,000.  Applicants will also be considered for tuition remissions, including the Concordia International Tuition Award of Excellence (PhD) valued at $35,949, and the Out-Of Province Tuition Remissions (MSc) valued at $6,000.
The XoRG is a vibrant and friendly group. The successful candidate will have many opportunities to present at conferences, write articles and disseminate her/his research. She/he will also take part in our collaborations amidst the Québec-wide Centre of Green Chemistry and Catalysis .
