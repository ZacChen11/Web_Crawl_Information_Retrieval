RESEARCH ASSISTANTSHIP
IN PHILOSOPHY
Time, Meaning, and Nature
About the research
Supervisor: Dr. David Morris, Professor of Philosophy
This research project aims to articulate new approaches to time, showing how these open new ways of understanding meaning and mind as unified with nature—whilst changing our concept of nature.
The project is centered in continental philosophy, in which time is a key theme of research. This research is marked by a shift from describing time as a framework in which alone we can do philosophy or experience change—change in time—to discovering a reality of time that must be understood in terms of change at a pre-personal level, prior to experienced or experiencable time—change ‘prior to’ time.
The project seeks to contribute to continental scholarship by working on this ontologically challenging reality of change that is ‘prior to’ experienced time. To do so, I draw on Merleau-Ponty’s philosophy, in relation to contemporary science. I seek to conceptualize time not only as real, but as a reality contingently arising out of being as internally open to a kind of change that cannot be directly manifest or analyzed in terms of time as we now encounter it. The sort of temporal ordering, direction, rhythm, etc., that we encounter in phenomena and experience, which is the starting point of analyses in philosophy of time, is thus conceived as an ongoing and contingent result of a deeper sort of ontological change. On this view, the genesis of a time order out of deeper ontological change is in effect the genesis of a kind of proto-norm in nature. This approach has implications regarding our understanding of nature, and thereby of the way that norms, difference, and meaning arise in nature.
Research will proceed by gathering, studying, and analyzing conceptual results about time in continental philosophy, philosophy more broadly, the sciences, and also cross-cultural and historical sources.
Financial commitment
The Research Assistantship is valued at approx. $4,970 CAD over two terms (prior to taxes), and the successful applicant may also be eligible for 1 to 2 research stipends of $4,500 CAD (prior to taxes).
Selected candidates will also be considered for merit-based entrance awards, bursaries and tuition remissions.
Requirements
Dr. Morris is looking to hire a philosophy student with a BA in philosophy who has knowledge of and/or research interests in the continental and/or phenomenological tradition, and ability to assist with research tasks, such as bibliographical searches, analyzing and summarizing articles. Skills in using bibliographical software such as EndNote, or assembling text-bases and using search software would be an asset; knowledge of the sciences, esp. biology, or physics (esp. cosmology, quantum mechanics), would also be an asset, but is not required. This opportunity is limited to successful applicants in the MA program in philosophy at Concordia.
