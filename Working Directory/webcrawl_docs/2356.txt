About the research
Dr. Thanh Dang-Vu, associate professor and director of the sleep research laboratory at Concordia University and the  PERFORM Centre  is seeking an MSc or PhD student to join a multidisciplinary team of neuroscientists, psychologists, physicists and engineers investigating the brain mechanisms of sleep and sleep disorders, as well the relationships between sleep and cognitive health.
The research program in the laboratory applies a combination of neurophysiological (EEG) and neuroimaging (structural and functional MRI) techniques to the study of sleep in healthy individuals and in clinical populations with sleep and/or neurological disorders. Research projects in the lab also involve behavioral and psychological assessments, and treatment interventions using mostly non-pharmacological approaches.
The research will take place at the PERFORM Centre and the Centre de Recherche de l’Institut Universitaire de Gériatrie de Montréal (CRIUGM). The PERFORM Centre is a multidisciplinary centre for health research on lifestyle management and prevention. It is a new research facility with state-of-the art sleep research, imaging, exercise, nutrition and rehabilitation equipment. The imaging suite includes a 3T GE 750 MRI machine, PET-CT, SPECT, EEG and NIRS equipment. The CRIUGM is one the largest research centers on aging and health with more than 50 research teams working on the neuroscience and health promotion related to aging. 
Candidates will have the opportunity to work with other researchers at Concordia, the PERFORM Centre, the CRIUGM, and investigators in other centres in Montreal and internationally.
 
Financial commitment
Selected candidates will receive a funding package comprised of Research Assistantship Bursaries, Teaching Assistantships, and/or entrance awards such as the Concordia University Graduate Fellowship, Merit Scholarship, Concordia International Tuition Award of Excellence (PhD), and the Out-of-Province Tuition Remission (MSc).
Requirements
The candidate should hold a degree in neuroscience, psychology, physics, physiology, biomedical engineering, or a health-related field. The candidate is expected to be a talented, enthusiastic, willing-to-learn researcher. Programming skills and exposure to sleep research, cognitive neuroscience, EEG and/or neuroimaging are assets.
