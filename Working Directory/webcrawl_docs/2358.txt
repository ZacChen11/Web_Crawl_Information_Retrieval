INTERDISCIPLINARY PhD
Economic resurgence in Indigenous communities
About the research
Anna Kruzynski , associate professor at the School of Community and Public Affairs and graduate director of the diploma in Community economic development, is seeking a PhD student to join a self-managed research collective working to map  emancipatory economic initiatives proliferating on the margins of the social economy in Quebec. This research project has been funded by SSHRC (2017-2022).
The candidate will be working with an Indigenous community to map practices of economic resurgence that are anchored in land, in language, in tradition. Following Indigenous worldview(s), the candidate will work to build relationships of reciprocity as they co-develop and enact a flexible and reflexive methodology that will be based on principles of resistance, political integrity and privileging of Indigenous voice(s). 
 
Financial commitment
Although academic autonomy is a given, the selected candidate is expected to conduct their fieldwork within the framework of the larger research project that is led by Professor Kruzynski. The candidate will be awarded a Research Assistantship to work with the research collective that is worth $14,500 (10 hours per week, following TRAC union rates) per academic year.  The selected candidate is also eligible for other opportunities, including Teaching Assistantships and entrance awards such as the Concordia University Graduate Fellowship ($32,400), Merit Scholarship ($10,000), and Concordia International Tuition Award of Excellence (PhD - $35,949).
Requirements
The candidate must have prior knowledge of economic resurgence in Indigenous communities on Turtle Island. Experience with Indigenist research methodologies and the ability to speak a second language (French or Attikamek) are assets but not requirements.
