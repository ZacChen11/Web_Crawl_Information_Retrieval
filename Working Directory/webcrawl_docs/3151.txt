Club Description: 
The Coalition Avenir Québec is a provincial, political party in Quebec. People who are truly engaged in promoting Quebec's socio-economic well-being within a federalist context should consider joining our club! The CAQ has kiosks on various student campuses at the post-secondary level. Additionally, there is an executive youth wing that is very community involved along with regional representatives in all corners of the province. They're actively engaged with our local MNAs, party members and citizens in order to highlight the preoccupations of Quebecers as well as pushing forth ideas for an innovative Quebec.
