Club Description: 
Our goal is to bring together students who share a love for reading. We will read relatable, enjoyable and thought-provoking novels. It is great to enjoy a book on your own, but it is even better to share the experience. Discussing a book with others gives the reader new perspectives on the book and can lead to insightful discoveries. Mind Your Books Club creates an environment that helps manifest these interactions. For more information, do not hesitate to contact us!
