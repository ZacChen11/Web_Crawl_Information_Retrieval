ESTU 611 Philosophical Perspectives in Education
This course is a forum for common inquiry and reflection upon issues that have deep significance for our lives as human beings, students, and educators. Some emphasis is placed on gaining an understanding of historically significant philosophical positions and their application to problems of teaching and education. However, the primary focus is on cultivating a desire and commitment to engage in philosophical thinking as it applies to matters of concern to teachers and teaching. The course is premised on a number of questions. These include but are not limited to: What is education? How do we understand education in its moral, ethical and spiritual dimensions? What role does education play (or have the potential of playing) in personal and social transformation? What is effective teaching and how can we cultivate the courage to teach effectively?
ESTU 612 Historical Perspectives in Education
This course acquaints students with a broad historical approach to a variety of significant educational issues. The emphasis will be placed on the examination of a number of critical components of modern educational thought and practice (comprising e.g., alternative schools of educational thought, politics and education, the changing curriculum, or the organization of schooling) as seen and presented in historical perspective.
ESTU 613 Anthropological Concepts and Methods in Education
The course introduces the students to qualitative methods in educational research. The first purpose is to review studies of education which utilize anthropological concepts and/or methods. The second purpose is to examine the three principal foci of qualitative research in the area: a. schools and their relations with the socio-cultural milieu in which they exist; b. the description and analysis of classroom processes; c. the study of individual pupils and educators. The third purpose is to assess the strengths and weaknesses of studies focusing on these areas. This includes describing and discussing some of the systematic methodological biases apparent in the literature and suggesting directions for future research.
ESTU 614 Social Psychological Foundations of Education
The course provides a basic understanding of the ways in which psychologists examine and analyze human behaviour, collect and interpret data, develop theories and form generalizations. It is not intended as a general survey course in the area of educational psychology. Several topics in an area will be studied in order to exemplify the methods and techniques employed in the psychological analysis of behaviour in educational settings.
ESTU 615 Introduction to Research in Education
By providing an overview of the commonly used research methods in education today, students gain the knowledge required to critique research that is reported in the education and social science literature.
