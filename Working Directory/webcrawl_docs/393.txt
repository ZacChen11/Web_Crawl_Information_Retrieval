During this week, students meet practitioners and individuals from local communities, industries and/or governments involved in EA. Through these interactions, students are exposed to a diverse range of perspectives and experiences related to EA. The course is validated through an assessment of the knowledge acquired during the trip. Students are responsible for the cost of food, accommodation and transportation associated with the one-week field trip (cost varies depending on destination).
Note: Students who have received credit for ENVS 662 may not take this course for credit.

Prerequisite: Permission of the EA Graduate Program Director.
Environmental assessment has risen to prominence during a time of escalating ecological crisis, rapid and uneven development (including the spread of neoliberal politics and economics), growing civil unrest and social movements, and significant shifts in environmental governance from local to international scales. EA shapes and is shaped by these trends. This seminar course surveys recent research in various fields (political ecology, science and technology studies, critical geographies, development studies) to acquaint students with this dynamic and pressing context. A key objective of the course is to build students’ capacity to reflect on the possibilities and limitations of EA as a political tool within struggles for social and environmental justice.

Required Courses
ENVS 601 EA: Concepts, Principles and Practice (6 credits)
Prerequisite: Permission of the EA Graduate Program Director.
This course aims to provide students with theoretical and practical knowledge related to environmental assessment and its role in project planning and policy development. The evolution of environmental assessment (EA), its current practices and functions, and future directions arediscussed. The roles and components of EA and EA procedures in Canada (at both the federal and provincial levels) are emphasized. Guest speakers, regular readings and in-class discussions supplement the lectures.
ENVS 652 Data Collection and Analysis for EA (3 credits)
Prerequisite: Permission of the EA Graduate Program Director.
This course focuses on methods and issues in data collection and analysis appropriate for impact prediction in the abiotic, biotic and built environment, including air, surface and ground water, soil, landscape, biodiversity, noise, cultural and socio-economic conditions.
Note: Students who have received credit for ENVS 662 many take this course for credit.
ENVS 653 Geographical Information Systems for EA (3 credits)
Prerequisite: Permission of the EA Graduate Program Director.
This course examines the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) in Environmental  Assessment (EA), particularly focusing on the role of GIS in the analysis of environmental data and in decision-making processes. Topics covered include data acquisition multi-criteria decision analysis, fuzzy sets and interpolation techniques. The course comprises lectures, lab exercises and case studies. The instruction is built around a series of practical exercises mainly using industry-standard GIS software. The objective of the course is to provide a sound theoretical and practical background in the use of geospatial technologies for EA applications.
Note: Students who have received credit for ENVS 663 may not take this course for credit.
ENVS 667 Situating EA: Knowledge, Politics and Development (3 credits)
Prerequisite: Permission of the EA Graduate Program Director.
Environmental assessment has risen to prominence during a time of escalating ecological crisis, rapid and uneven development (including the spread of neoliberal politics and economics), growing civil unrest and social movements, and significant shifts in environmental governance from local to international scales. EA shapes and is shaped by these trends. This seminar course surveys recent research in various fields (political ecology, science and technology studies, critical geographies, development studies) to acquaint students with this dynamic and pressing context. A key objective of the course is to build students’ capacity to reflect on the possibilities and limitations of EA as a political tool within struggles for social and environmental justice.
Elective Courses Open to MEnv and DEA Students
BIOL 618 Ecology for Environmentalists (3 credits)
Prerequisite: Permission of the EA Graduate Program Director.
This course discusses the principles of the ecology of individuals, populations, communities and ecosystems and the effects of environmental disturbances ranging from immediate pollution to long-term climate change.
Note 1: Students who have received credit for BIOL 508 may not take this course for credit.
Note 2: Students registered in a graduate program in Biology may not take this course for credit.
ECON 659 Economics for Environmentalists (3 credits)
Prerequisite: Permission of the EA Graduate Program Director.
This course considers one of the most serious problems facing our global civilization: the on-going conflict between economic activity and the bio-physical world upon which all human activity ultimately depends. The course explains the basic theoretical framework most economists use to describe economic activities and the relationship between these activities and the natural world. Understanding the logical apparatus of economics theory shows why market forces and environmental integrity are often in conflict and why economic arguments dominate environmental policy debates at both national and international levels.
Note 1: Students who have received credit for ECON 559 may not take this course for credit.
Note 2: Students registered in programs in Economics, or programs in the John Molson School of Business, may not take this course for credit.
ENVS 604 Environmental Law and Policy (3 credits)
Prerequisite: Permission of the EA Graduate Programme Director.
This course introduces students to environmental law and policy at the international, North American and regional levels with an emphasis on Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) as a tool for promoting environmentally sound and sustainable development. The course provides an overview of issues such as environmental security, Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), banking and environmental finance, access to justice in environmental decision making, climate change, biodiversity, and green growth. The role of international organizations and Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) is given particular attention.
ENVS 605 Environmental Standards (3 credits)
Prerequisite: Permission of the EA Graduate Program Director.
This course provides an overview of the International Standards Organization (ISO) standards and guidelines for industry to implement a sound Environmental Management System (EMS). These guidelines are outlined in a series of publications designated as ISO 14000. Topics covered will include: the evolution and benefits of EMS, the ISO 14001 principles, integration between ISO 9001 and 14001, the registration process, auditing an EMS, life cycle assessment, and environmental labelling. Upon successful completion of the course, students are encouraged to pursue formal accreditation.

HENV 655 Environmental Modelling (3 credits)
The different approaches to modelling the bio-physical, built or human environment are examined. The conceptualization of simple models to examine how human interventions affect the environment is investigated. Different modelling approaches such as system models, computer visualization and simulation are covered. Students develop a model scheme related to their thesis topic. Lectures and laboratory.
