Programs
Doctor of/Doctorate in Philosophy (Mathematics)
Master of/Magisteriate in Science/Arts (Mathematics)
Master of/Magisteriate in the Teaching of Mathematics
Doctor of/Doctorate in Philosophy (Mathematics)
Admission Requirements. Candidates will be selected on the basis of their past academic record, letters of recommendation and the relevance of the proposed area of research to the areas of specialization of the Department. The normal requirement for admission to the program is a MSc degree, with high standing in Mathematics or an allied discipline from a recognized university. Exceptional candidates who have successfully completed one-year’s study at the Master’s level may, upon approval by the Graduate Studies Committee, be exempted from the required completion of the Master’s degree and admitted directly into the PhD program.
Proficiency in English. Applicants whose primary language is not English must demonstrate that their knowledge of English is sufficient to pursue graduate studies in their chosen field. Please refer to the  Graduate Admission page  for further information on the Language Proficiency requirements and exemptions.
Requirements for the Degree
Credits. Students must complete a program of 90 credits, consisting of the following components:
Comprehensive examinations (12 credits);
Six courses or seminars (18 credits);
Thesis (60 credits).
Comprehensive Examination. The comprehensive examination is composed of the following two parts:
Part A (6 credits)
This is a written examination, consisting of two parts. The first part of the Comprehensive A examination is to test the candidate’s general knowledge of fundamental mathematical concepts. It will normally be completed within one year (3 terms) of the candidate’s entry into the program or the equivalent of part-time study. The second part of the Comprehensive A examination tests the candidate’s knowledge of topics in his or her area of specialization. The material will be chosen from the list of course descriptions given by the Graduate Studies Committee in consultation with the candidate’s research supervisor and the student’s Advisory Committee. Candidates are allowed at most one failure in the Part A examination.
Part B (6 credits)
The Comprehensive B examination is an oral presentation of the candidate’s plan of his or her doctoral thesis in front of the student’s Advisory Committee. It is normally taken within two-three years of the candidate’s entry into the program (or the equivalent of part-time study) and at least one year before the expected completion of the thesis.
Thesis. Concurrently with the preparation for the Part B exam, the students will be engaging in their research work towards the dissertation. After submitting the doctoral thesis, the candidate is required to pass an oral defence of the thesis. The doctoral thesis must make an original contribution to mathematical knowledge, at a level suitable for publication in a reputable professional journal in the relevant area.
Average Time to Completion. Normally a student completes all requirements for the degree, except for the thesis, within two years of entering the program. The normal period for completion of the program, for a student already holding the equivalent of an MA/MSc degree, is three to four years.
Academic Regulations
Academic Standing. Please refer to the  Academic Standing  section of the Calendar for a detailed review of the Academic Regulations.
Residence. The minimum period of residence is two years of full-time graduate study, beyond the MA/MSc, or the equivalent in part-time study. (A minimum of one year of full-time study is normally expected).
Time Limit. Please refer to the Academic Regulation page for further details regarding the Time Limit requirements.
Graduation Requirement. In order to graduate, students must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.00.
