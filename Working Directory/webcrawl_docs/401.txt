Courses
Required Core Courses
SCPA 501 Introduction to Community Economic Development (3 credits)
This course provides an overview of CED. It traces the historical and intellectual roots of CED as well as critically situates CED in the context of theories of community, local and regional development. Students are provided with basic tools of macro-economic analysis and policy evaluation as it relates to the practice of CED. This course focuses on the institutional environment in which CED initiatives operate to identify the potential and the limitations of local, community-based development strategies. Special focus is given to the perspectives of CED arising out of the feminist movement, cultural communities, Aboriginal communities, the popular sector and other social change movements.
SCPA 502 Comparative Approaches and Models in CED (3 credits)
This course focuses on the objectives of CED by examining the various strategies and diversity of models of CED practices in Quebec, as well as many found elsewhere in Canada, the United States, in Europe and in southern hemispheric countries. The differences in organizational structures and empowerment processes, as well as their social, cultural and economic context is studied and evaluated, mainly through case studies of selected communities.
SCPA 503 Fundamental Skills for CED Practice (3 credits)
This course focuses on helping students acquire a working knowledge of the practical skills required for building community economic capacity. This includes developing tools to map the material, environmental and human resources within communities. This course assists students in designing socio-economic indicators and a framework for evaluation of CED initiatives and strategic planning. Students are encouraged to identify, as soon as possible, how the use of such skills can be incorporated into either a CED project or an internship within a CED initiative.
SCPA 504 Community Organizing and CED (3 credits)
This course focuses on helping students acquire a working knowledge of the practical skills required in community organizing and capacity building for individual and community empowerment within a CED context. The course explores the role of popular education in community mobilization and collective action, and delves into the strategies, tactics and techniques of community intervention.
SCPA 505 Social Enterprise Development and Social Entrepreneurship (3 credits)
This course provides a framework for business development within a CED perspective. Basic tools for enterprise development, including comprehensive business planning, data evaluation, financial analysis, and forecasting are to be integrated into a social and ethical framework to maintain the democratic objectives of CED. Students develop skills in evaluating a successful commercial venture within the context of these larger objectives.
Project
SCPA 510 CED Field Project - Part I (3 credits)
SCPA 510 structures the Field Project. It introduces students to tools that can be used to design and implement their projects. During this course, students begin to implement their plan with the host organization. Assignments are based on the integration of the tools with the work undertaken in the field project.
Note: This course is part of the requirement that students complete a two-semester field project in some aspect of community economic development. This project is selected and negotiated by the student with a community organization and addresses a particular challenge raised within this setting.
SCPA 511 CED Field Project - Part II (3 credits)
Prerequisite: SCPA 510.
Students continue their field project for a second term within the framework of this course. They build on the practice of the previous term and advance it to reach the objectives established with their host organization. This course aims to strengthen the student’s skills in the critical evaluation of practice. Students examine their practice and the reasons for its success, as well as examine strategies for overcoming the barriers they faced. This course offers a framework for the final written report required of students, to be both shared with their host organizations and submitted for the course.
Areas of Concentration: Elective Courses
Areas of concentration are identified according to CED practices in order to help students choose elective courses relevant to their fields of professional specialization or of personal interest. Students will have indicated their priority areas of concentration on their application for admission form.
Up to five areas of concentration are offered, resources permitting, in a given year. The areas are: financing CED initiatives; housing, land use, and urban planning from a CED perspective; communications, technology and CED; international development and CED; Aboriginal CED.
Courses corresponding to these areas of concentration are the following:

Skills are developed to understand and generate financial planning, as well as investment decisions in traditional and non-traditional enterprises.
SCPA 509 Financing CED Initiatives: Part II (3 credits)
Prerequisite: SCPA 508.
This course uses a case study approach to critically examine and evaluate existing alternative CED initiatives in Canada and the US. This may include on site visits, interviews and occasional guest lecturers.
SCPA 515 Housing and Land Use from a CED Perspective: Part I (3 credits)
This course examines the institutional, economic, political, and environmental factors which affect land policy, and the development of affordable housing. It identifies public and private financial sources and various forms of ownership models including community land trusts and housing cooperatives, among others. Among the skills developed are those related to market analysis and housing needs assessment, site selection and control, and preparing housing projects.
SCPA 516 Housing and Land Use from a CED Perspective: Part II (3 credits)
Prerequisite: SCPA 515.

SCPA 529 : Développement international et DÉC. Partie I (3 crédits)
Ce cours examine les approches communautaires de développement économique des pays du Sud dans leur contexte socio-politique et historique. De nombreuses initiatives économiques du Nord s’inspirent de ces expériences. Le cours explore aussi les avantages et les désavantages de l’importation et de l’exportation de modèles et de pratiques de développement, et permet d’acquérir les compétences nécessaires pour évaluer l’à-propos de modèles de DÉC et les adapter, au besoin.
SCPA 530 : Développement international et DÉC. Partie II (3 crédits)
Préalable : SCPA 529.
La seconde partie de ce cours explore les réseaux et la collaboration Nord-Sud en identifiant les organismes non gouvernementaux, les groupes communautaires et les mouvements sociaux qui travaillent ensemble pour formuler des stratégies de DÉC dans leur pays respectif.

SCPA 536 : Le DÉC en mileu autochtone. Partie I (3 crédits)
Ce cours aide les participant-e-s à étudier des enjeux spécifiques liés au développement économique autochtone, en particulier le contexte (réserve, milieu urbain, rural ou nordique), ainsi qu’à affronter des défis fréquents en DÉC autochtone.

SCPA 537 : Le DÉC en mileu autochtone. Partie II (3 crédits)
Préalable : SCPA 536.
Ce cours utilise une approche d’étude de cas pour évaluer une ou plusieurs stratégies de développement économique communautaire en contexte autochtone.
