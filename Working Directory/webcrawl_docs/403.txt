Diploma in Clinical Psychology
Specific Information about all Programs
Admission Requirements. Admission to the PhD degree requires a master’s degree in psychology from a recognized university. Admission to the MA degree requires an honours degree in psychology or its equivalent. Enrolment in these programs is limited in part by the availability of research supervisors and, for the Research and Clinical Training Option, by space in that option.
Applicants are selected on the basis of past academic record, letters of recommendation, the results of the Graduate Record Examination (optional, but highly recommended), and the relevance of their proposed research to the research expertise of the faculty. Students successfully completing their master’s program in psychology at Concordia University need submit only an application form and letters of recommendation when applying for the doctoral degree. Psychology graduate courses are not open to graduate-level independent students, except in specific circumstances as defined by the department.
Upon recommendation of their thesis supervisor, students enrolled in the Master of Arts (Psychology) program at Concordia University who have completed a minimum of 12 credits of graduate level course work and who have shown high academic performance and potential through performance in research may apply for accelerated admission to doctoral studies without submitting a master’s thesis. Approval for accelerated admission must be obtained from the student’s thesis committee and the graduate admissions subcommittee by August 15 to allow entry into the PhD program in the Fall term. Students in the Research and Clinical Training option may not obtain accelerated admission to the PhD program from MA Year I, but may apply for accelerated admission, upon recommendation of their thesis supervisor, from MA Year II.
Proficiency in English. Applicants whose primary language is not English must demonstrate that their knowledge of English is sufficient to pursue graduate studies in their chosen field. Please refer to the  Graduate Admission page  for further information on the Language Proficiency requirements and exemptions.
Language Requirements. Although no formal language courses or examinations are required, students intending to work in Quebec are strongly encouraged to develop a working knowledge of French. Students who plan to seek admission to the Order of Quebec Psychologists (OPQ) are advised that Article 46 of the professional code of the Province of Quebec states that a working knowledge of French is required for professional certification.
Undergraduate Teaching. Students are encouraged to take opportunities to assist in undergraduate teaching. The department treats such teaching as part of the student’s learning experience. Discussion of aims and techniques as well as advice and criticism will be involved as part of the training that students obtain as teaching assistants.
Colloquia. All students are expected to attend departmental colloquia.
Academic Regulations
Academic Standing. Please refer to the  Academic Standing  section of the Calendar for a detailed review of the Academic Regulations.

PSYC 850 Practicum in Experimental Techniques (3 or 6 credits)
Prerequisite: Permission of the PhD Program Director.
This practicum is designed to give students the opportunity to develop their research skills by such activities as: (a) learning new experimental skills and techniques; (b) developing computer programs for the execution of experiments or the recording or analysis of experimental data; (c) developing new instruments to facilitate research on a problem, and other equivalent activities. Prior to beginning the work, students who elect to take this option submit to their thesis supervisor and to the program director a 3-5 page outline of what they want to do to meet the practicum requirements. Once the practicum is approved, students are responsible for carrying out the activities described in the outline. Students may complete one 6-credit practicum, or may complete up to two 3-credit practica. Changes in the content of the practica are indicated by a letter following the course number. The number of credits is based on the rule that 45 hours of work equals one credit.
