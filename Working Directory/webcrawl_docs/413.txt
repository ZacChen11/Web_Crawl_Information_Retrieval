Master of/Magisteriate in Applied Computer Science (MApCompSc)
Admission Requirements. Applicants must hold an undergraduate degree in computer science or a graduate diploma in computer science. Admission to the program is competitive and only applicants with high academic standing will be considered. The graduate studies committee, in consultation with the department, is responsible for recommending on all applications for admission.
Requirements for the Degree
Program of Study. The student, in consultation with faculty, must plan an individual program of study approved by the department graduate studies committee.
Credits. A fully-qualified candidate is required to complete successfully a minimum of 45 credits. Additional credits may be required in some cases.
Completion. Normally a full-time student will require six terms to complete the degree requirements.
Transfer Credits. A student may be granted credit for, in general, not more than 12 credits taken in approved graduate studies prior to his or her entry into this program. A course submitted for transfer credit must be appropriate to the student’s program of study at Concordia University. An application for such credit will be considered only at the time of admission.
Cross-Registration. A student in the program wishing to take courses under the cross-registration scheme outlined in the graduate calendar must first obtain permission of the graduate program director.
Time Limit. Please refer to the Academic Regulation page for further details regarding the Time Limit requirements.
Courses. Students must take a minimum of 45 credits of course work consisting of 12credits of core courses (COMP 6231, COMP 6651, and SOEN 6441) and 33 credits of electives including a minimum of 24 credits from Topic Areas C01 through C07. The electives may include ENCS 6931, COMP 6971, or COMP 6961, and a maximum of 8 credits chosen from computer science courses at the 6000 level marked with a (*); 4 credits chosen from COMP 5261 and COMP 5421; and 12 credits from Topic Areas C08 through C13, and C16. All students are required to pass a programming competency qualifying program in addition to and as part of their regular MApCompSc program.
Concurrent Qualifying Program. Students must take and pass a Programming Competency Test (PCT). The PCT is taken during their first term of studies after the first registration as full-time (part-time) students in the MApCompSc program. Students who fail the PCT are required to take COMP 5481 the next time it is offered by the Department, and achieve a grade of B or better. Until COMP 5481 has been successfully completed, students are only able to register for the core courses for their program. COMP 5481 counts as a course in addition to their program.
Programming Competency Test. Students take the Programming Competency Test (PCT) by registering for SOEN 6501. Students are assessed on the basis of a written test of their programming competency. The material covered in the PCT is the same as the material covered in COMP 5481. The PCT is normally administered by the Department.
Project. Students may choose to do a project as part of their program. They do so by registering for COMP 6971.
COMP 6971 Project and Report (4 credits). The purpose of the project report is to provide students in the MApCompSc program with an opportunity to carry out independent project work and to present it in an acceptable form. The project may consist of the following:
A theoretical study of a computer science problem.
A design and/or development project conducted at Concordia.
A design and/or development project conducted as part of the student’s full-time employment, providing the student’s employer furnishes written approval for the pursuit and reporting of the project.
Before registration for a project course, students must obtain written consent of a faculty member who acts as advisor for the report. A form for this consent is available in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering.
A four-credit report is due on the last day of classes of the term (fall, winter, summer) in which students are registered. Students are expected to have a preliminary version of their report approved by their advisor before its final submission. On or before the submission deadline, students must submit three copies of the report to their advisor, who grades the report. One copy of the report is returned to the student, one retained by the advisor, and one by the Department.
The report, including an abstract, must be suitably documented and illustrated, should be at least 5000 words in length, must be typewritten on one side of 21.5 cm by 28 cm white paper of quality, and must be enclosed in binding. Students are referred to the latest edition of Form and Style: Thesis, Report, Term Papers by Campbell, Ballou and Slade, published by Houghton Mifflin (Academic).
Industrial Experience Option in the Master of Applied Computer Science
Applicants to the Master of Applied Computer Science may apply to the Industrial Experience option in the industrial milieu through the Institute for Co-operative Education. Students should indicate their choice on the application form. The Institute for Co-operative Education will help them with resumes, cover letters and interview techniques. The suggested schedule is as follows: fall and winter terms will be dedicated to course work followed by one term in industry, culminating with two terms in University for the remaining course work. The industrial experience term will be noted on the student transcript/record.
Students apply to the Industrial Experience option as early as possible, preferably when they enter the program. It is preferable to be bilingual in French and English if they wish to work in Quebec. Students who lack good language skills and still want to be part of the program should improve their language skills prior to final acceptance.
Admission Criteria
Students need to be enrolled in the Industrial Experience option at least the semester before going on a work term. They begin applying for jobs the semester prior to the work term. Previous work experience cannot be used toward credit for the ENCS 6931. Students should have good grades (greater than a CGPA of 3.40) for the master’s program, be full-time and have good communication skills. A Canadian work permit is required. The Departmental Co-op Program Director will recommend final acceptance to the Industrial Experience option.
ENCS 6931 Industrial Stage and Training (9 credits)
Prerequisite: Completion of at least twenty credits in the program and permission of the Departmental Co-op Program Director.
This is an integral component of the Industrial Experience option that is to be completed under the supervision of an experienced engineer/computer scientist in the facilities of a participating company (a Canadian work permit is required).
Each student receives an assessment from the Departmental Co-op Program Director in consultation with the industry supervisor and the faculty advisor. Grading is on a pass/fail basis based on a proposal, monthly progress reports, a final report and a presentation.
