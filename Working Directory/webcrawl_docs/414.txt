Programs
Doctor of/Doctorate in Philosophy (Art History)
Master of/Magisteriate in Arts (Art History)
Doctor of/Doctorate in Philosophy (Art History)
Admission Requirements. Those applying for either full-time or part-time admission must possess a Master of Arts degree or its equivalent in Art History. Applications must include a thesis research project accompanied by a letter of support from the proposed supervisor in the department. Prospective students should therefore contact individual professors, or the Graduate Program Director, to find the right supervisor for their doctoral research project.
Proficiency in English. Applicants whose primary language is not English must demonstrate that their knowledge of English is sufficient to pursue graduate studies in their chosen field. Please refer to the  Graduate Admission page  for further information on the Language Proficiency requirements and exemptions.
Language Requirements. Since this is a bilingual program, applicants must demonstrate a level of competence that would allow them to read and to follow lectures and discussions in both English and French. The ability to speak and write with facility in both languages is not required; students may participate in discussion, and may write reports, examinations and theses in English or French, as they choose.
Admission Procedures. The interuniversity admissions committee reviews all applications.
Requirements for the Degree
Credits. A fully qualified candidate entering the program with a Master’s/Magisteriate degree is required to complete 90 credits. These are apportioned as follows: courses and seminars, 12 credits; research tutorial, 6 credits; doctoral forum, 3 credits; comprehensive examinations, 9 credits; and thesis, 60 credits.
Typical progress for a full-time student in the program would consist of:
First Year: Block A seminar (6 credits), one seminar from Block B (3 credits), one elective seminar, approved by advisor (3 credits), research tutorial (6 credits).
Second Year: Comprehensive examinations (before fifth semester) (9 credits), doctoral forum (3 credits).
Third Year: Thesis (60 credits).
Courses. The courses offered through the inter-university program are open to all students, regardless of the university at which they are enrolled. All students must take the Block A seminar (Art History and its Methodologies), one Block B seminar selected from one of six thematic categories under the general heading Art History and its Object, and either another Block B seminar or a graduate seminar offered by one of the four universities and approved by the thesis supervisor.
Comprehensive Examinations (ARTH 808). Before the fifth semester each full-time student must successfully complete one oral and two written examinations, which are evaluated by the three professors constituting the student’s thesis committee. These examinations are based on a pre-established list of readings focused on the theoretical and methodological issues which inform the student’s specific area of research. The exams are intended to verify whether the student is sufficiently prepared to undertake the writing of a thesis. Students who fail these examinations must take them a second time during the following semester. Those failing the second attempt will be withdrawn from the program.
Research Tutorial (ARTH 820). This tutorial is directed by the thesis advisor and is oriented to the student’s thesis topic. Its objective is to allow the student to articulate a detailed research project, define its corpus, and develop its theoretical and methodological hypotheses with a view to obtaining the approval of the thesis committee. This project, including an activity calendar, must be submitted at the end of the student’s first year. Students should register once work is completed and a grade has been assigned.
Doctoral Forum (ARTH 807). In the interests of promoting the development of an intellectual community within the program, a forum consisting of professors from the program and students engaged in their course work will be invited to present their ongoing research. The forum will be held once each semester during the academic year. Each student, at some point in his/her coursework, must give a paper based on his/her thesis research. This paper will be evaluated by a committee consisting of three professors and accorded a pass or fail grade.
Thesis (ARTH 830). The doctoral candidate must submit a thesis which makes an important and original contribution to knowledge in Art History. The thesis is defended orally before a committee composed of five individuals: the thesis advisor, the two other members of the thesis committee, one examiner from a department or program within the university other than the candidate’s, and one external examiner from outside the four universities.
