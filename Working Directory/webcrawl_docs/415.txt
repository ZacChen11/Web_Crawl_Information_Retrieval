Courses offered in the Certificate, Master’s and PhD programs in Engineering are one-term four-credit courses unless otherwise specified. Not all courses are offered each year. In these programs, a one-term course consists of one three-hour period per week for thirteen weeks, or equivalent. All 4-credit courses include a project chosen in consultation with the course instructor, requiring a written report. The final examination in the one-term course will be written after the thirteenth week, or during an examination period specified for each term. A course given in the summer term will, in general, consist of two three-hour periods per week for six and one-half weeks, or equivalent. For additional information concerning course descriptions and schedules, contact the appropriate department or the Office of the Associate Dean. (See note regarding the permitted number of credits from topic area E72 under the degree requirements section for each program). The courses are listed below, grouped under appropriate topic areas. The content of some graduate courses is equivalent to that of specified undergraduate courses. Such graduate courses, marked with (*), cannot be taken for credit by students who have completed the undergraduate equivalent. Courses marked with (**) cannot be taken for credit by students who have completed the Bachelor of/Baccalaureate in Engineering (Building) Program.
