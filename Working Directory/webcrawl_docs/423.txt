The role of financial information in corporate management is examined. Students learn how the capital markets process and aggregate information provided by firms and governments in order to evaluate the risk and return trade-offs of business decisions.

EMBA 620 Value Creation through Business Processes (3 credits)
This course looks at how companies can improve their business processes to deliver services or build products that are valued by their customers. In today’s business environment, companies are closely interconnected with global supply chains and distribution channels as well as multiple stakeholders. In this course, students learn to design, operate and improve a network of operations among various stakeholders to ensure that systems are properly managed so that the flow of material and information is fluid. Some of the topics covered include supply chain network design, service delivery improvement, sourcing, risk management and enterprise resource planning (ERP).

EMBA 630 Financial Decisions Under Uncertainty (3 credits)
Students apply recent advances in corporate finance theory to evaluate complex decisions that may have a profound effect on the future of a firm. Through the use of cases and projects, students evaluate and recommend different decisions within the constraints imposed by the ownership and governance structure of the firm. Examples include making choices on raising debt or equity, using capital for investment or to reward shareholders and whether to go public or remain private.
EMBA 631 Management Control Systems (3 credits)
In this course, students learn how to use performance measurement, evaluation and incentive control systems to create value for an organization and its stakeholders. Control systems are critical for success in the implementation of a firm’s strategy and the course highlights several managerial challenges in this regard. Students learn to use limited physical, human and financial resources efficiently and creatively within uncertainty conditions. A “how-to” approach is adopted that emphasizes practical cases and applications reflecting real organizational issues.
EMBA 632 Creativity and Innovation (1.5 credits)
Students are introduced to the theoretical concepts of creativity and innovation with the goal of implementing novel ideas in organizations. The purpose is to develop students’ own creative abilities to solve business challenges in a more effective way. Based on lectures, case studies and experiential exercises, the course also proposes techniques needed to foster innovative processes in others.
EMBA 633 Applied Field Project I (1.5 credits)
The first part of this two-part integrative course provides students with an opportunity to tackle a major business problem or issue of their choice, thereby allowing them to apply the knowledge and competencies acquired to date.

A project proposal is the main assignment for the course.
EMBA 635 Starting a New Venture (3 credits)

Elements of the leadership development module are integrated and leveraged within the course in order to improve students’ ability to lead with purpose, inspire others and enable change.
EMBA 641 Corporate Governance (1.5 credits)
Students learn the principles and practices underlying governance, the system by which organizations are directed and controlled to create value for their shareholders but also to all stakeholders involved in its value chain.  Students review how an organization’s governance structure allocates rights and responsibilities to make decisions among stakeholders and specifies procedures for decision making.
