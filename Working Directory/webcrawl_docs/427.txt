Credits. Fully-qualified candidates are required to complete a minimum of 45 credits.
Academic Regulations
Credit Load: Full-time Students. The normal course load for full-time students is 12 credits in each of the terms in the first year; 6 credits and the 15-credit applied research project in the second year.
Credit Load: Part-time Students. The maximum course load for part-time students is 12 credits per calendar year. The 15-credit applied research project should take 6 to 12 months to complete.
Course Reduction. In exceptional circumstances, students may be granted permission to reduce their course load below the normal specified above while remaining in good standing.
Program and Course Withdrawal. Students who wish to apply for withdrawal from the program must do so in writing at the office of the Associate Dean, Research and Research Programs. Students may drop a course up to the end of the course change period. This is normally about two weeks after classes begin (see Academic Calendar). In addition to the regulations which appear in the Graduate Registration section of the Graduate Calendar, students enrolled in the program are required to observe the following rules.

Graduation Requirement. In order to graduate, students must have a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.00.
The degree requirements for the program consist of the following:
6 credits of core seminars:
MSCA 602: Applied Linear Statistical Models (3 credits)
MSCA 615: Research Methodology - Administrative Sciences (3 credits)
15 credits of Supply Chain Management seminars:
MSCM 681: Advanced Modelling and Optimization (3 credits)
MSCM 682: Sourcing and Global Logistics (3 credits)
MSCM 683: Supply Chain Design and Coordination (3 credits)
MSCM 684: Demand Management (3 credits)
MSCM 685: Supply Chain Risk Management (3 credits)
9 credits of elective seminars (see Elective Seminars)
and subsequently 15 credits: MSCM 689: Applied Research Project
Elective Seminars
Taking an elective seminar is subject to the academic advisor’s approval. Each year a selection of specialized seminars are offered on a rotating basis from those listed below.
MSCA 625 Seminar in Options and Futures
MSCA 632 Seminar in Special Topics in Finance
MSCA 645 Seminar in Organization Theory
MSCA 647 Seminar in Strategic Management
MSCA 652 Seminar in Special Topics in Management
MSCA 668 Seminar in Innovation and Marketing
MSCA 672 Seminar in Special Topics in Marketing
At most one elective seminar at the graduate level can be taken outside of JMSB. 
Qualifying Program
Up to three qualifying program courses are taken by those students who do not have a Supply Chain Management or Industrial Engineering degree. These courses are specified at the time of admission by the Admissions Committee, based on the academic background of the student. The qualifying program courses need to be successfully completed prior to starting the regular master program.
Supply Chain Management Seminar Descriptions
MSCM 681 Advanced Modelling and Optimization
This seminar emphasizes the theoretical and practical aspects of advanced optimization modelling techniques in supply chain planning. Among the topics covered are network optimization, non-linear programming, stochastic programming, Markov processes and application of duality in developing decomposition-based solution approaches for large linear and integer models. Use of commercial modelling platform and optimization software are an integral part of this seminar.
MSCM 682 Sourcing and Global Logistics
This seminar covers the practices, techniques and regulations associated with sourcing and movement of materials in the global supply chains. Among the topics covered on sourcing are impact of globalization on sourcing, supplier evaluation and selection, supplier performance management, purchasing, electronic procurement, negotiations, contract law, supplier relationship management. Issues in global logistics are discussed in the second half of the seminar. Among the topics covered are distribution channels, warehousing, transportation management, reverse logistics, green logistics and sustainability, and cross-border issues in logistics. The coverage is supplemented by case studies and research articles.
MSCM 683 Supply Chain Design and Coordination
Prerequisite: MSCM 681 or equivalent.
This seminar focuses on managerial and modelling issues in supply chain design and coordination along the supply chain. Models in facility location, distribution networks and global supply chain networks are studied. The strategic aspects of supply chain design are discussed in terms of competitive drivers. The second part of the seminar deals with coordination issues. Among the concepts and models covered in this respect are supply chain contracts, collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment, bullwhip effect, postponement, and vendor managed inventory. Articles, case studies, optimization software and simulation game are used as part of seminar delivery.
MSCM 684 Demand Management
The seminar presents advanced forecasting tools that assist market analysis, revenue management tools that optimize operational performance and approaches in building flexibilities to enhance manufacturing and organizational capabilities. Among the topics covered are advanced forecasting models, judgmental forecasting and adjustment, customer relationship management, consumer choice models, dynamic pricing, capacity control, network revenue management, manufacturing and organizational flexibilities. The seminar content is delivered via a combination of lectures, case analyses and research articles.
MSCM 685 Supply Chain Risk Management
Prerequisite: MSCM 681 or equivalent.
Strategies for managing the various risks along the supply chain are studied. Quantitative and qualitative approaches used in analyzing such risks and scenarios are covered. The seminar discusses risk identification and management, trade-offs in risk management, strategies for robustness, scenario planning, financial risks and disruption planning. The approaches used for modelling and analyzing the supply chain risks are presented through lectures, case analyses and research articles.
MSCM 689 Applied Research Project
Prerequisite: at least nine credits of MSCM seminars.
Supervised (co-supervised) by a faculty member(s), the applied research project is carried out individually or by a group of two students, depending on the overall requirements and the extent of the project to be conducted. The project involves working on a real-life supply chain management problem provided by a company. Once the problem is defined, the students prepare an overall project management plan to tackle the problem within a given time limit. The various stages of the project involve, among others: literature review, defining data and information requirements for problem analysis, gathering data, designing the appropriate model, conducting experimental design runs and sensitivity analyses, and presenting the solution(s) with an implementation plan. The project outcome is expected to have both academic and business merit. For projects done in groups of two students, there is a significant individual evaluation component in assessing the work done by each student.
