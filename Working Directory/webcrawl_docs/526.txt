Personal information collected
Concordia Stores recognizes the need for consumers to       control the use and management of personal information. By personal information we mean information       that can be used to identify or contact an individual. If you are visiting our site to       browse merchandise or find information about our business or our products, you do not need to provide       any personal information. If you decide to make a purchase, however, we do collect this information       so that we can provide you with the product or service you requested and so that we can contact you       with information regarding your order.
Personal Information Use - Concordial Stores uses personal information provided by       you so that we can service your order. Also note that we may need to transfer that information to       our agents or employees of our service providers. For example, we may need to provide your address       to a wholesaler or a shipping company that will ship a product directly to you. We will only transfer       the information to the extent necessary to provide the requested information, service, or product to       you. We will not sell or trade your information to unrelated third parties. When you submit an order       you will receive an email confirmation from our system. As your order status changes you may also       receive notifications via email. These notifications are considered part of our service and may not       be disabled. We may also periodically send you email notifications concerning products or services       offered by our bookstore. Any such notification will include instructions for opting out of future       mailings.
Third parties
We do partner with other third parties to provide various products and services.       When you sign up for these services or products we will share required personal information that is       necessary for the third party to provide the product or service to you. We take reasonable steps to       ensure that these third parties are obligated to protect your information on our behalf. We will not       sell or trade information collected online to unrelated third parties. We may,       however, release personal information if we are legally required to do so. If we are legally compelled       to release information to a third party, Concordia Stores, may or may not notify you of this       release. Notification will be at the discretion of Concordia Stores and will be based on the       nature and conditions surrounding the release of information.
