VISITING & EXCHANGE
An exciting feature of any university education is the contact students make with individuals from around the world. However, nothing compares to actually discovering the world for yourself!
Concordia International student mobility programs
Options for Concordia students
Concordia Student Exchange Program (CSEP)
This program allows Arts & Science students to study abroad for a semester or two at one of Concordia's partner universities. These universities have exchange agreements with Concordia, which allows students to study abroad while continuing to pay Concordia tuition. 
More about CSEP
Visiting fee-paying option
Arts & Science students interested in studying at an institution that does not have an exchange agreement with Concordia may still be granted permission to do so. In this situation, students would be required to pay tuition directly to their host university. In order to be considered for this option, students must submit a Student Request Form to Student Academic Services. 
 
Options for students from abroad
Study exchanges 
This program allows students from one of Concordia's partner universities to study in the Faculty of Arts & Science. These universities have exchange agreements with Concordia, which allows students to study at Concordia while continuing to pay their normal tuition.
More about study exchanges
Visiting international fee-paying student
International students who would like to take courses in the Faculty of Arts & Science may be admitted as a Visiting International Fee-Paying student (VIFP). As a VIFP, you are responsible for paying Concordia tuition fees.
Steps to follow to become a VIFP in the Faculty of Arts & Science:
In order for the Faculty to evaluate your request to study within the Faculty, we require the following documentation:
Transcript from your school indicating your academic standing as well as your program of study. Students must be in good academic standing at their home institution.
A letter of permission from the Program Advisor or Office of the Registrar of your home institution indicating the course(s) that you are interested in taking and the term(s) in which you would like to study. Please remember that priority for course registration is given to Concordia students requiring courses for their current programs of study. If sufficient space is available, you will be permitted to register for these courses.
The Visiting Request Form . This must be submitted, along with the above mentioned documents to Birks Student Service Centre, LB 185, 1455 de Maisonneuve Blvd, Montreal, Quebec.
Language results (TOEFL, IELTS, MELAB, CAEL, CAE, CPE) if an international student whose primary language is not English. Please refer to our language proficiency requirements .
If you have any questions pertaining to this process, please contact:

Transfer students
Transfer students are accepted to the university based on their previous academic history. Students transferring from accredited institutions will receive transfer credits, when possible, that will count toward the degree. Specific course transfer may be possible if they are required for the program of study. Transfer credit determination, however, is only evaluated after an admission application has been submitted to the university. Specification of transfer credits may require a department assessment after an offer of admission has been given.
Residency requirement rules require that a minimum of 45 credits, these normally being the last 45 credits, and at least 50% of your program be completed at Concordia University. The four year (120 credits) Early Childhood and Elementary Education (ECEE) and the Teaching English as a Second Language (TESL) program require that a student completes at least 60 credits at Concordia University.
For more information, please visit the Office of the Registrar .
