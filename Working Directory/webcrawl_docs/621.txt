Prevention
The key to reducing the risk of becoming a victim of crime is prevention. Crimes can be avoided by following the guidelines:
Pedestrian Safety
When it comes to road safety – whether you’re driving, cycling or simply walking – being aware of your surroundings is key.
The reality is that pedestrians today are distracted by electronic devices, and often they aren’t paying attention long enough to make sure they’re not walking into traffic.
With both the Loyola and Sir George Williams campuses situated along busy streets, the safety of pedestrians and cyclists as they negotiate these roadways is an important priority for Concordia’s Security Department.
That’s why the Security Department focuses on prevention through education and offers these helpful tips below.
 
Pedestrian Safety
Make yourself visible to drivers and cyclists: wear reflective or light clothing at night, stay in well-lit areas, and make eye contact with drivers or cyclists prior to crossing their path.
Do not text or talk when walking, wear headphones, or partake in other sources of distraction. You need your senses about you to avoid accidents.
Follow the rules and yield to traffic with right of way. Do not assume traffic will stop for you, always assess your own safety before proceeding.
Stay on the sidewalk whenever possible.
Consider other modes of transport, like calling a taxi or having a designated driver, if you are going to be drinking. Alcohol consumption impairs your reflexes and decision making abilities while walking, too.
Do not walk in vehicles blind spots.
Do not cross an intersection diagonally unless signs or peace officers indicate otherwise.
Remember where you have right of way:
Pedestrian lights: Right of way during walk (white silhouette) or flashing hand signal
Traffic lights: Right of way on the green light only
Stop signs at intersections: Right of way at all times
 
Bike Safety
Wear a helmet and ensure it is adjusted properly (Insert helmet adjustment graphic).
Ride in a straight line.
If there is more than one lane, ride in the far right lane.
Signal turns and lane changes and check to ensure your path is clear  (Insert image of bike signals).
Watch for vehicle taillights to signal turns or stops.
Watch vehicle occupants to avoid being hit by an opening car door.
Make eye contact with drivers before proceeding into an intersection to ensure they will yield right of way.
Use bike lanes where possible.
Cyclists must yield to pedestrians at intersections.
Ride single file if with other cyclists.
Under the Highway Safety Code , cyclists are prohibited from:
Cycling on highways, on-ramps, and exit ramps.
cycling against the flow of traffic (unless signage dictates otherwise)
cycling on sidewalks
using earphones while cycling
cycling between multiple lanes of moving vehicles
cycling without or with faulty brake systems
carrying a passenger without appropriate seating
drinking while cycling
Did you know it is mandatory to have the following accessories while cycling?
Rear red reflector
Front white reflector
Reflectors on spokes of both wheels, visible from either side
Amber reflectors on both pedals
 
Concordia’s Security Department provides cyclists with a free flashing bike light and reflective strap. Just visit Security Desk on the Sir George Williams Campus (Henry F. Hall Building, Room H-118 or on the Loyola Campus in Room SP-144 in the Richard J. Renaud Science Complex) to get  
 
Driver Safety
You can do your part to keep pedestrians and cyclists safe by following these guidelines:
Do not text or talk while driving.
Do not drive while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
Obey all road signs and traffic lights.
Yield to pedestrians.
Yield to cyclists with right of way.
Use your lights and signal properly.
Take extra care during severe weather and/or when visibility is limited.
Before you open your car doors, check for cyclists and/or pedestrians. You can be subject to a fine (between $200-$300) for opening a door without shoulder checking and hitting a cyclist.
 
How to pass cyclists:
Speed limit greater than 50km/h:
Reduce the speed of your vehicle
Maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (≤50km/h) 1.5 meters (>50km/h) when passing a cyclist
Do not pass in the same lane
Do not cross a solid line to overtake a cyclist
Violating these measures as part of the Highway Safety Code may result in a steep fine and 2 demerit points.

Follow these guidelines to prevent becoming a victim of bicycle theft:
Register your bike: You can register your bike online, with the Tandem organization, or at your local SPVM station.
Lock your bike to one of the designated bike stands on campus (Link to bicycle parking page – under campus maps)
Use a reliable lock, take any easily removable pieces with you.

Fraud and Cyber Safety
Perpetrators of fraud are successful because they prey on our carelessness in our daily lives.  By being careless when conducting business transactions, when responding to calls or requests for donations solicited over the internet, or when discarding personal documents without shredding them, we increase the risk of becoming victims of fraud.
The most common types of fraud are:
Bank or credit card fraud
Internet fraud
Identity fraud
For more information, see Fraud, Service de police de la Ville de Montréal
