PhD Oral Exam - Yu Lin Nie, Business Administration
Three essays on acquisition and CSR choices and firm value: Role of managerial traits and actions
November 24, 2017, 10:15 a.m. – 1:15 p.m.
When studying for a doctoral degree (PhD), candidates submit a thesis that provides a critical review of the current state of knowledge of the thesis subject as well as the student’s own contributions to the subject. The distinguishing criterion of doctoral graduate research is a significant and original contribution to knowledge.
Once accepted, the candidate presents the thesis orally. This oral exam is open to the public.
Abstract
This thesis consists of three essays that examine the role of managerial traits (specifically managerial conservatism, interest alignment with shareholders and debtholders, beliefs about firm value and hubris) on their firms’ acquisition and CSR choices and their valuation effects. All the essays use hand-collected pension plan data.
The first essay finds support for a managerial conservatism explanation for acquirer acquisition choices and M&A price effects. More conservatively managed acquirers are more likely to use cash as the method of payment and to target less risky firms (e.g. being public or having lower leverage or managerial conservatism). We find that acquirers experience poorer price effects for stock versus cash payment even after controlling for the equity price effect and that these price effects monotonically deteriorate with increasing managerial conservatism, consistent with the agency problems associated with managerial conservatism. These results remain robust using propensity score matching, a four- or five-factor model, the BHAR methodology, top five executives instead of CEO when measuring managerial conservatism, and the inclusion of various controls (e.g., multiple or single acquirers, policy uncertainty, business cycle, managerial hubris, firm mispricing and Republican orientation).
The second essay finds that managerial interest alignment with shareholders (debtholders) of acquirers is positively related to the likelihood of using stock (cash) as the M&A payment method, positively (negatively) related with M&A acquirer equity price effects, and negatively (positively) related with M&A acquirer bond price effects. While managerial conservatism is positively related with an acquirer’s CSR ranking it is negatively related with an acquirer’s M&A price effects. Information about an acquirer’s misvaluation contained in pre-announcement short selling by investors and the abnormal trading of its executives also affects the acquirer’s choice of payment method and M&A price effects.
In the third essay, we conduct a comprehensive examination of the dynamic relations among CSR composite rankings, firm undervaluation, executive compensation and corporate governance. Our measure of firm undervaluation based on insider trading captures information not captured by commonly used mispricing measures. We use system-GMM and 3SLS for a system of four simultaneous equations to control for endogeneity and simultaneity. Our evidence indicates that a firm’s future CSR ranking is positively related to firm undervaluation and negatively related to managerial conservatism. We find that the trading of managers reveals informed information about the “error-in-expectations” embedded in firm valuations.
