Media and mass atrocity: the Rwanda Genocide and beyond
December 1, 2017 – December 3, 2017 (all day)
Carleton University's School of Journalism and Communication, in collaboration with the Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI) and the Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies (MIGS) at Concordia University will host a major international roundtable - Media and Mass Atrocity: the Rwanda Genocide and Beyond - from December 1-3, 2017, at Carleton University.
As the 25th anniversary of the 1994 Rwanda genocide approaches, there is still much to learn about the nexus between mass atrocity and the media, an issue laid bare by the Rwanda tragedy. The roundtable will bring together an international network around the question of media and mass atrocity.
As more information about the Rwanda genocide becomes available and as the narrative of those events continues to evolve, we still have much to learn from the important case study of Rwanda about the role of media in stimulating and responding to mass atrocities. In particular, in an era of social media saturation, near-ubiquitous mobile device penetration, and dramatic shifts in traditional news media, it is more important than ever to examine the nexus between media and mass atrocity. Advances in information and communications technology have reshaped the media landscape, rendering mass atrocities in distant countries more immediate and harder to ignore.
And yet, a cohesive international response to mass atrocities has been elusive. Social media tools can be used to inform and engage, but also - in an echo of hate radio in Rwanda - can also be used to demonize opponents and mobilize extremism. With enhanced and relatively inexpensive communications technologies, ordinary citizens around the globe can capture live footage of human rights abuses before journalists have the chance, making social media itself a global actor, affecting the responses of national governments and international organizations to threats against peace and security and human rights.
Despite the extended reach that technological advances have afforded traditional news media and social media, the media impact in mass atrocity events is still a complex subject. Specifically, we are left with many troubling questions, still unresolved despite the passage of time since Rwanda. What role do media play in alerting the international community to looming mass atrocity? Could more informed and comprehensive coverage of mass atrocities mitigate or even halt the killing by sparking an international outcry? How do we assess the impact of hate media reporting in a killing spree? What is the role of the media in trying to encourage amelioration of the conflict or post-conflict reconciliation? What do the lessons of Rwanda mean now, in an age of communications so dramatically influenced by social media? Media and Mass Atrocity: the Rwanda Genocide and Beyond, grapples with these very questions.
Members of the public are invited to join in this three-day event, to observe the proceedings, take part in question-and-answer sessions and interact with the members of the roundtable.
Participants must register online in advance of the event. 
The full conference registration package includes a dinner and event opening ceremony on Friday, December 1 (held in the Atrium on the second floor of Richcraft Hall), as well as coffee breaks and lunches on Saturday, December 2 and Sunday, December 3 during the roundtable, held in the third-floor conference room of the Residence Commons building at Carleton. The registration fee is being charged on a cost-recovery basis.
