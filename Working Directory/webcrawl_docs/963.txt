Six Concordia graduates are among the nominees for the 2017 Quebec Writers’ Federation (QWF) Literary Awards.
The winners will be announced at a gala ceremony at Montreal’s Lion d’Or on Tuesday, November 21.
This year’s finalists include the following alumni:
Concordia University First Book Prize
Ariela Freedman, BA (English lit. & western society & culture) 94, Arabic for Beginners (Linda Leith Publishing)
Freedman’s novel Arabic for Beginners focuses on Hannah, a married mother who moves to Jerusalem, Israel. There, she meets a group of expat women at her son’s daycare, as well as a young Palestinian woman named Jenna. As Hannah grows close to Jenna, she starts to question her own marriage and her relationship to Israel. Freedman is an associate professor in Concordia’s Liberal Arts College.
Jocelyn Parr, MA (hist.) 06, MA (Eng.) 11, Uncertain Weights and Measures (Goose Lane Editions)
Also shortlisted for the 2017 Governor General’s award for fiction, Parr’s debut novel Uncertain Weights and Measures is about Tatiana, a scientist, and Sasha, an artist, a couple meet in a Moscow bookstore the night it is bombed in 1921. They fall in love but eventually grow apart as ideology and politics get between them in post-Revolution Russia.
J. Jacob Potashnik, BA (comm. studies) 82, The Golem of Hampstead and Other Stories (Penny-A-Page Press)
The QWF describes Potashnik’s collection of short stories The Golem of Hampstead and Other Stories “in the tradition of Saul Bellow, Mordechai Richler, and reminiscent of the work of Isaac Bashevis Singer and Sholom Aleichem, among others.”
Cole Foundation Prize for Translation — French to English
Claire Holden Rothman, MA (Eng.) 88, Sun of a Distant Land (Véhicule Press), a translation of Soleil (Les Éditions la Peuplade) by David Bouchet
Bouchet’s debut novel follows 12-year-old Souleye, who has just immigrated with his family to Montreal from Senegal. He must now learn to deal with what it means to be black in a predominantly white society. The QWF says Sun of a Distant Land is “poignantly translated” by Rothman.
QWF Prize for Children’s and Young Adult Literature
Lori Weber, BA (Eng.) 89, Lighting Lou (DCB / Dancing Cat Books)
Loosely based on a true story, Lightning Lou is about a 12-year-old boy named Lou who pretends to be a girl so that he can play on an all-girls’ hockey league team. Lou wrestles with the moral dilemma of posing as a girl while competing with the league’s star player and his chief rival, Albertine Lepensée.
QWF Literary Prize for Young Writers
Nicola Sibthorpe, BA (Eng. & cr. writing) 17, age 22, “Artemisia Absinthium,” published in Headlight Anthology , Concordia University.

The Grand Prize will go to the best short story, poem or work of non-fiction written in English by Quebec residents between 16 and 24 years old and published in an official literary publication in 2015 or 2016. Sibthorpe is now pursuing a Master’s in English with a Creative Writing option at Concordia.

Alum Philip Lanthier wins Judy Mappin Community Award
The Quebec Writers’ Federation (QWF) has named Philip Lanthier, BA (Eng.) 59, winner of the 2017 QWF Judy Mappin Community Award.
A professor, editor and festival director, Lanthier has long championed the work of Quebec English-language authors.
“I feel very pleased, honoured and happy, especially since this is the Judy Mappin Award,” says Lanthier, a graduate of Loyola College, one of Concordia’s founding institutions. “I remember her Double Hook bookstore on Greene Avenue [ which closed in 2005 ]. Judy Mappin was always friendly and helpful, a marvelous bookstore owner, and to win this award associated with her is truly a wonderful thing.”
Lanthier has taught at Champlain College in Lennoxville, Que., and Bishop’s University in Sherbrooke, Que. In 1975, he founded Matrix, the influential literary magazine that has published generations of emerging Quebec writers for more than 40 years.
Since 2010 Lanthier has steered the Knowlton Literary Festival in Brome Lake, Que., which celebrates work written in English by local and out-of-town authors. The Montreal Gazette describes the festival as “one of the best-run and most enjoyable small-scale events of its type in Canada.”
“The festival is expanding. I’ve got a terrific team and support from the town and community,” Lanthier says. “I think championing the work of English-language authors is extremely important to the overall culture of Canada, and I am completely devoted to it.”
He adds, “I love reading Canadian poetry, Canadian novels, seeing Canadian plays. To be able to put these writers in contact with communities like the one we have in Knowlton is tremendously satisfying. It is also delightful to see how well people respond to meeting writers. Often, meeting writers in a festival setting is a revelation to people.”
Lanthier says his time at Loyola was “crucial in my development, notably two English teachers, Father Gerald MacGuigan and John Buell . They helped me develop my own writing skills and set me on my academic career.”
At Loyola he edited the Loyola News student newspaper and co-edited the literary magazine Amphora.
Lanthier is “very upbeat” about the future of Canadian literature. “It is more important than ever,” he says. “Canadian writers are crucial to our identity — who we are, where we’ve been and where we’re going. They perform an essential function by helping us discover our own history.”
Lanthier will receive his honorary award at the 2017 QWF Literary Awards event on November 21. For more information and tickets, visit qwf.org/awards .
