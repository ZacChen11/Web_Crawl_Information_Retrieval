Advising for Undergraduate Students 2017-18
New BComm and BAdmin Students
To prepare for your first year at JMSB and get advice on how to choose your courses, please complete the following three steps in the order that they appear:
Step 1
Log into your  MyConcordia Portal  and pay the Admissions Confirmation Deposit.
See a step-by-step guide to paying the Admissions Confirmation Deposit.
Once you have paid the deposit, the computer system will run a batch process sometime within 24 hours and you will be cleared to register for your university courses.
 
Step 2
Please visit our orientation website for new JMSB students and get organised for your first year of university!
The website will help you understand your academic program, choose your first-year courses, and help you navigate the course registration system in the MyConcordia Portal.
 
Step 3
Login to your  MyConcordia Portal , click on My Student Centre, click on Enroll in the Academics menu to begin choosing courses.
See step-by-step guides to Course Registration in your MyConcordia Portal.
Use the  Course Registration Guide  to navigate the process of choosing your classes; especially steps 3, 6 and 7. Plan your schedule using the Undergraduate  Class Schedule  and  Undergraduate Calendar .
 
Note: The information provided in these videos is currently being updated and is subject to change without notice. Please consult the Undergraduate Calendar for up-to-date rules and regulations regarding your studies.
Common registration issues
BTM 200 is an online course, this is why there is no classroom included in the course listing. Do not try to register for the in-class section of BTM 200 unless the terms of your government financial aid prohibit you from online learning.
You should always register for all available terms as early as possible. Fall and Winter courses should be selected at the same time.
When selecting courses, you must register for prerequisite or co-requisite courses before higher-level courses, especially when you choose to complete co-requisite courses in the same term.
Example: you must register for COMM 205 before COMM 210, even if you choose to complete these two courses in the same term, because COMM 205 is a pre- or co-requisite for COMM 210. If you try to register for COMM 210 before COMM 205, the system will block you and show an error message telling you that you do not have the prerequisites completed.
Example: you must complete COMM 205 and 210 before registering for COMM 222, however, you are permitted to register now for COMM 205, then 210, in your first term and then register for COMM 222 in your second term because the system recognizes that the prerequisites are expected to be completed by the time you begin COMM 222.
Click here for a detailed troubleshooting guide to registration.

New Students in Business Certificates
Students admitted to the Certificate in Accountancy, Certificate in Business Studies or the Certificate in Foundations for Business will not find specific information pertaining to course registration in the videos. However, we still suggest that you watch the videos.
New Certificate in Foundations for Business
Students admitted to the Certificate in Foundations for Business are required to attend registration advising sessions. Please monitor the email account you provided to the University for your invitation to our sessions.
Returning JMSB Students
Students are urged to register for both Fall and Winter courses according to the registration start dates indicated in the  Enrollment appointment dates  for Fall 2017 and Winter 2018. Start dates are also provided to students through the  MyConcordia  Portal.
Failure to register for both Fall and Winter terms as early as possible may result in an unfavourable schedule or in extreme cases the unavailability of required courses. No special arrangements will be made if you delay your registration.
Program Planning Worksheets for all undergraduate programs offered by the JMSB are available on the JMSB website. Program Planning Worksheets allow students to track their progress in their program and facilitate course selection for future registration. Please visit Forms and Worksheets  to print a copy of the worksheet for your specific JMSB program. You will not be able to proceed with your registration if you attempt to bypass any of the following academic regulations:
register for courses prior to your registration start date;
register for a course before completing the listed prerequisites;
register for a course concurrently with the listed prerequisites;
register for more than your allowed course load;
register for a course that is restricted to specific Majors and/or Minors, other than your own.
 
Registration for Summer Courses
Due to limited course selection in the Summer terms, students may not be able to register for a full course load. Hence, you are strongly encouraged to register as early as possible. Please see the  Enrollment appointment dates  for Summer 2017.
Non-business Students
Students not enrolled in a program offered by the JMSB may register for a maximum of 6 business credits per term for an overall total of 30 business credits.
NOTE: The 30 credits include failed courses. Priority for registration is given to current JMSB students over non-business students. As such, space may not be available for all non-business students wanting to register in specific business courses.
