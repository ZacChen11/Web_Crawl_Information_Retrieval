It is the responsibility of the Requestor to provide the CSU with accurate, complete and up-to-date information within the delay set forth by the DSA, and to inform the CSU of any new or relevant information regarding the Event that may occur after receiving approval from the CSU to hold the Event, failing which the request may be declined or the approval of the Event rescinded, as applicable;
